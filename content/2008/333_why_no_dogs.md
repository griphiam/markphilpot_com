	Damn it!  Why is everyone so against pets in the housing and rental markets (especially the latter).  Yes, I know, I know... If you were a landlord you wouldn't exactly want pets around because the might damage something or be a sound annoyance... but damn it!  There has to be people out there who make apartment buildings or condos that are pet friendly.<br />

Ann and I have wanted a dog since we graduated.  Our building in DC didn't allow them and when we starting looking for an actual house, that was one of the primary reasons for it.<br />

Again, here we are in California wishing we could have a dog...  We're starting again to look for something that will accommodate pets (as well as being simply larger), but having that criteria drastically reduces your options...  That just really sucks.
