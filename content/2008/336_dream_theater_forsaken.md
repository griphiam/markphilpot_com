After not releasing a music video in almost a decade, with Dream Theater moving
to Road Runner records, they 've released three for the new album Systematic
Chaos (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkF4JD2rO3Q">Dark Eternal
Night</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgP1bjCfCNI">Constant
Motion</a>). Their latest is their most radio friendly, and a great song to boot
=) The music video is incredibly unconventional and a great twist from what
you'd expect given the lyrics (vampires)... Its a love story with some
fantastical twists!

Its really well done, and thank god for youtube, because eMpTyV would never have
played this.
