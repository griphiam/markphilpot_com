It's quite shocking to hear all the voice actors of these shows all in one place. While I expect there to be quite a few of unique hilarious moments with this one, the first few episodes have been rather slow. Hopefully we can get to a point where there is some fast back and forth banter.



### [Fairy Gone](https://anilist.co/anime/107418)

Frankly, I'm a little disappointed with this one -- I had higher expectations from PA Works. I really like the music and OST, so I think that will keep me coming back at a minimum. The show tries to take itself very seriously and puts characters together because *plot* rather than natural development.

*sigh*




### [Boku-tachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai](https://anilist.co/anime/103900)

Back to back seasons of the tutor trope? *sigh*

That being said, I've enjoyed the first view episodes more than I thought I would so maybe that will be enough.




### [Hitoribocchi no Marumaru Seikatsu](https://anilist.co/anime/101386)

Every episode has left me with a permanent smile on my face! Soooo good! Definitely recommend this one!





### [Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin](https://anilist.co/anime/102939)

Sort of feels like a poor man's version of [ACCA 13](https://anilist.co/anime/21823/ACCA-13ku-Kansatsuka/) so I'm going to give it a chance to hopefully present some interesting situations.




### [Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine](https://anilist.co/anime/104989)

Round out the season with a sports anime. By episode three we've rounded out a full cast of nine players each with their own quirks and foibles. This should be enjoyable in a way that only a sports anime can.
