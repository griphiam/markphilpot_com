Since I put the first season of *Mob Psyco* on hold (and subsequently never finished it) I won't be watching it's second season (I know, I know... my loss).

I'm not at all familar with the original (done almost 20 years ago at this point) so I went in completely cold turkey. First impression was excellent and a good decision to air the first two episodes at once. There seems to be a bit of overlapping character designs which caused a bit of confusion as to who is who, but I think I've manged to get the three initial groups straight now. The non-linear storytelling takes effort as there aren't a lot of queues for you to anchor on.

The OP and ED are each fantastic as well!

> Dororo, a young orphan thief, falls into the company of Hyakkimaru, a powerful demon-hunting Rounin. Before Hyakkimaru's birth his father, a greedy feudal lord, made a pact with 40 demons and let them each take a piece of his unborn son's body, in return for granting him great power. Hyakkimaru was born without arms, legs, eyes, ears a nose or mouth, a barely human creature, and his father had him thrown in the river. He was rescued and raised by Dr. Honma, who made him artificial limbs and helped him learn to fight the demons - each time he defeats one he reclaims one piece of his body. Now he and Dororo travel together through the war-torn countryside.<br/><br><br><br/>(Source: ANN)

Short and crass, but the voice acting steels the show. This is going to be a fun short to follow each week.

This is almost a text book example of how *not* to structure your opening episode. No stakes, no context, and no hints at conflict until the last 20 seconds of the episode (post credits).  A perfect counter example is [Gakkou Gurashi!](https://anilist.co/anime/20754/Gakkou-Gurashi/)'s opening episode. There is an underlying sense of "not all is right" and a lot of hints at what is happening "outside" during the course of the episode to put you on your guard.

I'll tune in next week to see what this conflict is and how they are going to structure the greater narrative, but I bet lots of people drop this show without ever getting to the conflict.
