If you have access to HBO, I highly recommend "Deadwood."  I've been very impressed with HBO's original programming (I not ashamed to say I really enjoyed the last season of Sex and the City).  There are some really interesting characters, and HBO's ability to go no-holds-barred into a script because they don't have to worry about sensors really comes through (though Ann does object to the extensive use of "cocksucker"... no idea how authentic that is)  =)

Anyway, do check it out if you can (I'm sure you can also download episodes off of p2p if you needed to as well).
