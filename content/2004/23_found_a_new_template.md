... but decided to go with a whole new blogging subsystem.  <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> is simply more powerful!  I've definitely had fun setting it up.  I found this template I like, but I need to dive into it to <em>correct</em> the color schemes so it better matches my site.  There are so many new things to figure out, that it will take me a while to get it all under control, but if you're looking for a blogging system, I definitely recommend it.
