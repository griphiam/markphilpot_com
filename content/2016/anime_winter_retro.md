[TOC]

So I was unable to get to the "sequels" for this season (*Gate*, *Ansatsu Kyoushitsu*, and *Akagami no Shirayuki-hime*). All three I will hopefully complete at some point (especially *Shirayuki*) but this was a crazy quarter personally and I ended up really only having time for a few shows.

I've also started reading manga on a regular basis. I have a bunch of series I'm enjoying (some from shows I've watched and some new ones) and as a result my evening time is spread even more.

Holy... Mother...

The opening two episodes hooked me so badly I ended up watching each episode as soon as it came out (until episode 10 where I had to pause and wait for it to finish so I could binge the rest). While this show might not appeal to everyone (specifically if you are disinclined to like anything from A-1 or don't like mysteries) I think it's easily the best show to air in the last few years.

From what I've heard, the manga might be even better since there was quite a few threads dropped in order to fit into a single cour. I'm a few chapters in at the moment and definitely think that consensus might be right.

For me this was the surprise of the season. The humor was consistently good throughout and even the art style while jarring at first meshed well with the humor. The entire production was just *fun*!

### [Dimension W](https://hummingbird.me/anime/dimension-w)

My initial assessment was spot on -- I kept my expectations low and was pleasantly surprised. The characters aren't deep and they have minimal arcs, the character design is OK, and the plot is mildly interesting. That might come across as damming, but the sum of the pieces resulted in something fairly entertaining. If you just want a decent sci-fi show to pass the time, this one isn't too bad.

### [Musaigen no Phantom World](https://hummingbird.me/anime/musaigen-no-phantom-world)

Oh the disappointment. The world had so much potential, but the writers seemed content with standalone surface level character pieces. I mean, it's KyotoAni so it's gorgeous to look at, but there was no depth aside from the art. *sigh* Chalk this one up to missed opportunity.

Haven't started this one yet, but I will definitely get to it.

### [Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) 2nd Season](https://hummingbird.me/anime/ansatsu-kyoushitsu-tv-2)

This one too. Given it's a two cour season, I'll probably wait until the end before diving in.

### [Hai to Gensou no Grimgar](https://hummingbird.me/anime/hai-to-gensou-no-grimgar)

This is [Sword Art Online]() with amnesia and by the opening of episode 2, they definitely make it clear this is not your parents SAO. The killing of the goblin was honestly difficult to take it. It was clear this was essentially murder and seeing how the characters processed that event was striking.  This wasn't like SAO where enemies just went *poof*. I'm really curious to see where this goes.  A final note on episode 2 -- taking almost a full 5 minutes of dialog-less animation with a fantastic song after the killing of the goblin was a gutsy call and in my mind paid off in spades.

### [Akagami no Shirayuki-hime 2nd Season](https://hummingbird.me/anime/akagami-no-shirayuki-hime-2)

I seem to do this a lot -- I put off watching the second season of a show I really liked. The reason seems to be split between the urge to watching something *new* versus "completing" something I liked and having no more *new* stuff afterwards.

I didn't get around to starting this one either, even though it was one of my favorite shows when the first season aired. It's the curse of the anime fan -- never having a chance to catch up with your "To Watch" queue.

### [Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm](https://hummingbird.me/anime/ao-no-kanata-no-four-rhythm)

I got a few episodes in before putting it on hold. I think I would have been more interested if it had more "sports anime" influences. I don't think it's a bad show, just meh.

![Pony Canyon]({filename}/images/anime/studios/pony_canyon.png "Pony Canyon"){: .studio}

### [Dagashi Kashi](https://hummingbird.me/anime/dagashi-kashi)

Couldn't do it -- mostly because I can't relate to the food he show revolves around. Ultimately there might be a story hidden underneath but I didn't have the patience to find out.

### [Haruchika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun Suru](https://hummingbird.me/anime/haruchika-haruta-to-chika-wa-seishun-suru)

This one got moved to the held column pretty quickly because other shows were more interesting.

![Madhouse]({filename}/images/anime/studios/madhouse.png "Madhouse"){: .studio}

### [Prince of Stride: Alternative](https://hummingbird.me/anime/prince-of-stride-alternative)

I'm fairly sure I'm going to end up dropping this one. Just not enough there to keep my interest. 

![Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu]({filename}/images/anime/2016/winter/shoujotachiwakouyawomezasu.jpg "Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu"){: .center}

### [Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu](https://hummingbird.me/anime/shoujo-tachi-wa-kouya-wo-mezasu)

I'm half way through this one and will probably end up just an average show. A lot will depend on how much they the characters versus just the process of making this game, which I only find mildly interesting. 

![Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu]({filename}/images/anime/2016/winter/rakugo.jpg "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu"){: .center}

### [Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu](https://hummingbird.me/anime/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinjuu-tv)

Ok, this show will not be for everyone, but give the first episode a try.  The show centers around a style of Japanese storytelling and we actually get to see the full stories.  The comedic ones feel like a one-man Abbot & Costello routine and this is definitely a show where I wish I could understand Japanese because I feel it would be even better.

### [Ooyasan wa Shishunki!](https://hummingbird.me/anime/ooyasan-wa-shishunki)

Quirky and fun, but nothing to write home about. The humor is actually decent and the 2 minute run time means you can binge the season in less time than a single normal show.

### [Mahou Shoujo Nante Mou Ii Desukara.](https://hummingbird.me/anime/mahou-shoujo-nante-mou-ii-desukara)

While there was some nice pokes at the typical magical girl tropes, I feel they should have hit a lot harder. Ultimately pass on this one.
