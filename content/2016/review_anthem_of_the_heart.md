Anime movies are a treat that requires quite a bit of patience. Unlike series that are translated and aired immediately movies require us to wait until the DVD or BluRay release and pray some sort of distribution agreement is made.

Released in September of last year, *Anthem* had been on my radar for a while, but never got a distribution agreement. It's such a shame that almost everyone outside the anime community won't get a chance to see this film. Stories like this seems to be relegated to Japanese Anime exclusively -- you would never see Disney or Pixar take on a project like this.  Projects like *Anthem* and [Koe no Katachi](https://hummingbird.me/anime/koe-no-katachi) are the reason I love anime.
