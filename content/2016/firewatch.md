This game does interactive movie better than any other game I can think of. This is not a role playing game in the traditional sense -- your actions don't influence the plot of the story but rather the relationship between the two main characters. That wasn't what I thought it was going into the game, so when the opening sequence began and I was presented with picking between only bad choices I was caught off guard.

That quickly faded as I feasted upon both the spectacle of the forest and the incredible voice acting.

The art style and visual rendering of the forest really makes it s character in its own right. It's not a true open world and the day-night cycle is tied to story cues but that didn't detract from the experience for me.  Instead of striving for realism, they went for stylized beauty (very reminiscent of *Journey* in its execution).

I loved the voice actors for both Henry and Delilah. The choices in the dialog tree allow you to push and pull various aspects of the relationship -- almost like tuning.
