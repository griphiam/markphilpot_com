[TOC]

You'll notice [Boku no Hero Academia](https://hummingbird.me/anime/boku-no-hero-academia) is not listed below. I guess I'm just not as much a fan of the *shoenen* category as everyone else as *Academia* has no draw on me.  I might try it at some point, but I think I'd rather give *Hunter x Hunter* a try instead.

### [Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu](https://hummingbird.me/anime/re-zero-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsu)

Umm... This is not at all what I was expecting, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't already hooked. The show opens with a double length first episode (40 minutes). At the half way point I was about to shrug it off as yet another "Boy trapped in another world" show -- and then the first loot house scene happened.  Yeah. Wasn't expecting that.

This is a two cour show (24 episodes) and I have absolutely *no* idea where this plot will go. There is quite a lot left unexplained about the world and characters that it really could go anywhere.  Keeping my fingers crossed for this one.

### [Koutetsujou no Kabaneri](https://hummingbird.me/anime/koutetsujou-no-kabaneri)

Two for two in the unexpectedly surprised category.

Essentially this is [Attack on Titan](https://hummingbird.me/anime/attack-on-titan) with zombies but even out of the gate I think I'll like this show a lot more than AoT. For one, it looks like they will avoid the whole "go to school" angle and for two the protagonist is already *much* more likable than Eren ever was. The animation looks very similar to AoT as well, so they are obviously channeling that vibe. I really liked the steampunk atmosphere and train motif. I just hope the character development delivers (I'm already concerned that the main character Ikoma could be very one dimensional).

### [Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows](https://hummingbird.me/anime/kanojo-to-kanojo-no-neko-everything-flows)

I *want* to watch this one, but it doesn't seem like anyone is picking it up.  I will have to track it down somewhere.

### [Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?](https://hummingbird.me/anime/netoge-no-yome-wa-onnanoko-ja-nai-to-omotta)

> Our naïve protagonist proposes to a female character in an online game, only to find out that the player is actually a guy. Traumatized by that, he decides to never trust a girl online, but now, two years later, a female player is proposing to him. What will happen?<br/><br/>(Source: Unlimited Novel Failures)



![Bungou Stray Dogs]({filename}/images/anime/2016/spring/bungoustraydogs.jpg "Bungou Stray Dogs"){: .center}
![$STUDIO]({filename}/images/anime/studios/bones.png){: .studio}

### [Bungou Stray Dogs](https://hummingbird.me/anime/bungou-stray-dogs)

Bones, Bones, Bones. Need I say more?

A super hero detective agency channeling [Kekkai Sensen](https://hummingbird.me/anime/kekkai-sensen) -- the first episode was definitely entertaining with the humor flowing and some nice stylized action sequences.  I wonder if this one will have a story arc to it or focus more on individual standalone stories.

### [Gakusen Toshi Asterisk 2nd Season](https://hummingbird.me/anime/gakusen-toshi-asterisk-2nd-season)

Why? *Why?* **Why??**

I finished the first season which really wasn't any good. A coin flip if I get around to this one.



![Flying Witch]({filename}/images/anime/2016/spring/htraii_flyingwitchv2.jpg "Flying Witch"){: .center}
![$STUDIO]({filename}/images/anime/studios/jc_staff.png){: .studio}

### [Flying Witch](https://hummingbird.me/anime/flying-witch)

This one is a fantastic counter balance to *Re:Zero* and *Kabaneri* -- you need something to offset the intensity, and I think *Flying Witch* will suit me nicely.  I'm hoping this fills the role that [Non Non Biyori](https://hummingbird.me/anime/non-non-biyori) did.  I have high hopes for this one.


![Kiznaiver]({filename}/images/anime/2016/spring/main02.jpg "Kiznaiver"){: .center}
![$STUDIO]({filename}/images/anime/studios/trigger.png){: .studio}

### [Kiznaiver](https://hummingbird.me/anime/kiznaiver)

> The anime's setting is a fictional Japanese city named Sugomori City. One day, Noriko Sonosaki tells her classmate Katsuhira Agata, "You have been selected to be a Kiznaiver." The Kizuna System, which allows Katsuhira to share his wounds, connects him to the classmates whose lives and personalities completely differ from his. The Kizuna System is an incomplete system for the implementation of world peace that connects people through wounds. All those who are connected to this system are called Kiznaivers. When one Kiznaiver is wounded, the system divides and transmits the wound among the other Kiznaivers. Sugomori City is built on reclaimed land, but as the years go by, the city's population is decreasing. The story is set in this town where Katsuhira and the others live.<br/><br/>(Source: ANN)

### [Joker Game](https://hummingbird.me/anime/joker-game)

> The original novel is set in 1937, before World War II begins in earnest. Lieutenant Colonel Yūki of the Imperial Japanese Army forms the "D Agency," an army intelligence outfit under his command and tutelage. Army General Staff attaches Lieutenant Sakuma to observe the unit's performance. D Agency casts a wide net to find agents beyond Japanese military personnel, and Yūki establishes D Agency's tenets, which go against IJA doctrine: "Don't kill, don't get killed, don't get captured." With this, Yūki trains a team of operatives who conduct missions against domestic and foreign powers.<br/><br/>(Source: ANN)

### [Sousei no Onmyouji](https://hummingbird.me/anime/sousei-no-onmyouji)

> Rokuro is from a family of exorcists, but he'd rather be a singer, a soccer player or anything but an exorcist! He's forced to own up to his own incredible potential when new arrival Benio stirs his competitive spirit. But their rivalry gets a twist when they earn the prestigious title of "Twin Star Exorcists"—two supreme fighters fated to marry and birth the ultimate spiritual warrior!<br/><br/>(Source: VIZ Media)

### [Kuma Miko](https://hummingbird.me/anime/kuma-miko)

> The manga follows Machi, a middle school student who serves as a shrine maiden at a Shinto shrine and takes care of a bear, who lives on mountain in Japan's northern Tohoku region. The bear, Natsu, has the ability to talk and is Machi's guardian. When Machi explains to Natsu that she will attend a school in the city, he gives Machi a set of trials that she must pass in order to be able to survive city life.<br/><br/>(Source: ANN)

![$STUDIO]({filename}/images/anime/studios/pa_works.png){: .studio}

### [Kuromukuro](https://hummingbird.me/anime/kuromukuro)

Netflix picked this one up, but it looks like it will be released much later in the year (no idea why). A bit in the dark on the plot for this one, but I'm usually willing to give shows by PA Works a chance.



![Shounen Maid]({filename}/images/anime/2016/spring/uyedwa_shounenmaid.jpg "Shounen Maid"){: .center}
<div class="studio">8bit</div>

### [Shounen Maid](https://hummingbird.me/anime/shounen-maid)

A late addition for me -- I was going to pass this up as the premise seemed ridiculous, but I ended up catching a review of the first episode and decided to give it a try. I ended up enjoying it despite the over the top setup.  It reminded me a little of what I think a modern take on [Kaichou wa Maid-sama!](https://hummingbird.me/anime/kaichou-wa-maid-sama) might look like. The interaction between the two main characters had charm and without one side having power over the other.
