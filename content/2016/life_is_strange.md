Narrative-focused games are few and far between. There are seemingly hundreds of *Battlefront* or *Destiny* style games for every story-based game. Given the absolute shit show that is the gaming community right now, this game embodies everything "the GG side" seems to despise: character driven story based game led by a duo of female protagonists.

All the more reason why we need more games like this. *I* want more games like this. More games like *Gone Home*, *Dreamfall Chapters*, and *Firewatch*.

*Life is Strange* has its flaws to be sure, but I refuse to let that detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a game.

*Life is Strange* takes place in a small town called Arcadia Bay, following Max, a shy and reserved high school girl at a school for artistic students. After stumbling into an 'incident' in a bathroom, she discovers she has the ability to rewind time. And... scene.

I want to start by saying I can't think of any other game was obviously made to look and feel like a movie and manages to pull it off to the degree *LiS* does. The camera placement and tracking, the visual filters, the color pallet -- all are heavily leveraging their feature film counterparts. For most of the game, the over-the-shoulder camera transitioned smoothly with the tracking camera and back again to the point where it didn't feel like separate "Game Play", "Cut Scene", "Game Play" phases.
