Summary: First Impressions of the Anime Winter 2016 Season
status: draft


A-1 Pictures is going to town this season!  With three shows in my list, we get some retread of [SAO]() with some interesting art style while also having perhaps the sleeper hit of the season.

This mean I now get to actually finish the first cour (I usually do that to avoid the season ending cliffhanger). My impression of the first cour was *meh* but it was interesting enough that I'm curious if we'll get any more depth in the characters.

[Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) 2nd Season](https://hummingbird.me/anime/ansatsu-kyoushitsu-tv-2) <br/>

This should be a solid installment this season.  The first cour was fun and entertaining despite some uneven pacing.

To say that the first episode sucked me in is a significant understatement.

> Struggling manga author Satoru Fujinuma is beset by his fear to express himself. However, he has a supernatural ability of being forced to prevent deaths and catastrophes by being sent back in time before the incident occurred, repeating time until the accident is prevented. One day, he gets involved in an accident that has him framed as a murderer. Desperate to save the victim, he sends himself back in time only to find himself as a grade-schooler one month before fellow classmate Kayo Hinadzuki went missing. Satoru now embarks on a new quest: to save Kayo and solve the mystery behind her disappearance.(Source: MAL News)

On first glance, this appears to be a more light hearted version of [Beyond the Boundary](). The animation definitely doesn't disappoint.

> In the near future, spirits and monsters are in full sight.A boy leads a group of people with special abilities as they plot against a massive organization that takes advantage of a certain incident and eventually know the truth about their world in the process.Is the world the real thing...? Or is it a mere phantom...?(Source: Official site)

[Hai to Gensou no Grimgar](https://hummingbird.me/anime/hai-to-gensou-no-grimgar) <br/>

This is [Sword Art Online]() with amnesia. The art style is so far the most distinguishing characteristic.  I rather like it, but I bet you it will have a rocky reception.

> Why are we here? Why are we doing this?Before Haruhiro had realized what happened, he was surrounded by darkness. Why was he here? Where was here? Even now, he still didn't know. Those around him were the same as him, no one remembered anything other than their own names. And when they emerged from the darkness, the world that awaited them seemed like something out of a video game.In order to survive, Haruhiro forms a party with the others, learns fighting skills, and as a soldier in the reserve force, takes his first steps into the world of Grimgar. What awaits him there, he doesn't know...This the story of an adventure born from the ashes.(Source: NanoDesu)
