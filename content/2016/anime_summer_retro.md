*Holy Shit*

Ok, so this show has it's flaws to be sure, but damn was this a fun ride.  White Fox managed to expore some dark aspects of the main protagonist and really drags the audience around through the muck of dispair. I had hope during each episode that things would come back up... that we were taking this downward trajectory with the expectation that we would come back up after hitting rock bottom (and oh did we hit bottom all right).  Thankfully, the payoff is really good and rewards your investment in the show.

Let me take a moment to talk about Episode 18.

Actually, no. Words would not do this episode justice. If I just described it to you (two characters talking to each other in the same spot for 24 minutes) you would say it must be a boring episode. Trust me when I say that Episode 18 might just be my all time favorite episode of anime ever.

Binged? ✅ <br/>
Enjoyed? ✅ <br/>
Want Second Season? ✅

What a truly fantastic adaption! They were very faithful to the source material while still making it their own. They also managed to end the season with both a resolution and a tease for more that was actually satisfying (though to be fair that might be because I've been reading the manga). I really, **really** hope there is a second season in store for us down the road.

Ugh. I couldn't even start this because I feared how much of a downer it would be. I probably wasn't wrong given the bits of reactions I managed to hear. I *will* watch this at some point. It just might not be anytime soon.

So most people seemed to have loved this show (maybe not quite as much as One Punch Man). It just wasn't my cup of tea. It's on hold rather than dropped as maybe someone will review it and really make me feel that I will be missing out if I don't watch it.

Such. A. Slow. Start.

The problem through really is that once it gets going no one really bothers to tell you where. The characters are no more than cardboard cutouts of anime stereotypes and I really don't see that developing or evolving. Another one on hold -- I think I heard something that there might be a second season? *Shrug*

### [Tales of Zestiria the X](https://hummingbird.me/anime/tales-of-zestiria-the-x)

This was not a great anime by any stretch of the imagination. It's more or less a straight adaption of the game. It inexplicably has a 2 episode tangent to promote the prequel game set in the same universe. The main character is essentially *deus ex-machina* personified.

Now, all that being said, I did rather enjoy it.  The music is fantastic and the animation is flat out gorgeous (if you happen to like the ufotable digital style). To top it all of, it got me to buy the game (on sale on Steam) and introduced me to the entire *Tales of* series of games that hadn't crossed my radar prior.

So... Mission Successful?
