[TOC]


Every time a new season rolls around I think it's going to be a light one because most of it is completely unknown to me before watching the first episodes. I definitely don't try absolutely everything, just ones that catch my eye. You'll notice this first impressions post is a bit later than usual -- I thought I wouldn't have that many shows to watch this fall, so I took the time to finish up a few remaining summer shows.  It really wasn't until I created the skeleton for this post that I realized how many had caught my eye enough to give it a try.

Also, I guess the Crunchyroll/Funimation links for each show are kind of useless -- with the "partnership" announcement all the subtitled works will end up on CR anyway. There are a few from last season that Funimation announced they would be doing a dub for that I'm curious for (Re:LIFE), but it looks like going forward most things will be on CR. I'll note the shows that *aren't* on CR.

Anime Gods be praised! KyoAni has blessed us with a second season! **So** excited for this! The first season was up there on my all time favorite anime. The only question I have is if they will take the story all the way to nationals or dangle that for a third season.

While you wait, please enjoy the following selection:
