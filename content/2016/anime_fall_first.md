Summary: First Impressions of the Anime Fall 2016 Season

[TOC]


Every time a new season rolls around I think it's going to be a light one because most of it is completely unknown to me before watching the first episodes. I definitely don't try absolutely everything, just ones that catch my eye. You'll notice this first impressions post is a bit later than usual -- I thought I wouldn't have that many shows to watch this fall, so I took the time to finish up a few remaining summer shows.  It really wasn't until I created the skeleton for this post that I realized how many had caught my eye enough to give it a try.

Also, I guess the Crunchyroll/Funimation links for each show are kind of useless -- with the "partnership" announcement all the subtitled works will end up on CR anyway. There are a few from last season that Funimation announced they would be doing a dub for that I'm curious for (Re:LIFE), but it looks like going forward most things will be on CR. I'll note the shows that *aren't* on CR.

### [Hibike! Euphonium 2](https://hummingbird.me/anime/hibike-euphonium-2)

Anime Gods be praised! KyoAni has blessed us with a second season! **So** excited for this! The first season was up there on my all time favorite anime. The only question I have is if they will take the story all the way to nationals or dangle that for a third season.

While you wait, please enjoy the following selection:

### [Drifters](https://hummingbird.me/anime/drifters-tv)

Not sure this is the show for me. I'm not a fan of [JoJo's Bizare Adventure]() so I think some of the humor and art style is lost on me. I also thought the pacing and timing of the jokes was really off for the opening episode.  I think I'll give it one more shot to hook me but if I was a betting man I would pre-slot this over to *Dropped*.

### [3-gatsu no Lion](https://hummingbird.me/anime/three-gatsu-no-lion)

Wow! It's Shaft not doing a [Monogatri]() series. I love the art style, the restrained use of dialog and the OST is fantastic too. I'm firmly sold on this one (and it's a two cour show to boot!)

### [Yuri!!! on Ice](https://hummingbird.me/anime/yuri-on-ice)

The strong opening episode really caught me off guard. The comedic timing was superb and there was a level of confidence and sincerity exuding from the show that really hooks you in while the comedy acknowledges not to take the show too seriously. It was a fantastic combination. Give this show a chance even if you would initial balk at the subject. I don't think you will regret it.

### [Shuumatsu no Izetta](https://hummingbird.me/anime/shuumatsu-no-izetta)

*Sigh*

I was actually rather enjoying the opening episode right up until the witch Izetta *mounted* the rifle as if it was a broom and started flying. That rather unfortunate shot to the system got me to realize all the other flaws and suddenly I wasn't quite as interested. I will still give this one a few more episodes but frankly I don't have high hopes for this.

### [Trickster: Edogawa Ranpo "Shounen Tanteidan" yori](https://hummingbird.me/anime/trickster-edogawa-ranpo-shounen-tanteidan-yori)

Another Ranpo adaptation and this one starts off with a kick! Nothing really explained in the first episode but with a two cour show, they can afford to take their time. The animation is top notch and there is every indication the dialog is going to be chalk full of some clever banter. Definitely a keeper.

### [Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari](https://hummingbird.me/anime/udon-no-kuni-no-kiniro-kemari)

Literally [Sweetness & Lightning]() meeds [Usgi Drop](). I have my doubts that this will be anywhere near as good as S&L however. Apparently death, food and a cute kid are a winning combination. I'll stick this one out as long as they keep a good level of character development going.

### [Gi(a)rlish Number](https://hummingbird.me/anime/girlish-number)

Wow. Not at all what I expected. There is quite a lot of not so subtle ribbing going on here. This one feels like [Shirobako]()'s evil twin taking the whole experience down a few notches. Let's see where this one goes.

### [Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku](https://hummingbird.me/anime/mahou-shoujo-ikusei-keikaku)

How much will this just be a inferior clone of [Madoka Magica]()? I hope it's more than that, but I have my worries. There could be lots of room to play around with this as long as they have the confidance to break out of Madoka's shadow. Not sure if this original or an adaption (not that it really matters, just curious more than anything). Hopefully we get to see a new side of a *Mahou Shoujo* turned on its head.

> The publication of a new dictionary titled The Great Passage progresses. Mitsuya Majime, originally from publisher Genbu Shobo's sales department, has been recruited by Kouhei Araki, a veteran editor of the dictionary department who is looking to retire soon. The dictionary department is known internally as the "money-eating insect," but Mitsuya uses his perseverance and attachment to the words in order to become a great editor. Mitsuya, who has poor social skills, finds himself working with another man named Masashi Nishioka, who is able to express himself better.<br/><br/>(Source: MAL News)

This one has the potential to be the gem of the season. The animation is georgous and an absolute trip. No idea where this one's going, but I'm definitely in for the ride.

### [Soushin Shoujo Matoi](https://hummingbird.me/anime/soushin-shoujo-matoi)

> It is 2016. Matoi Sumeragi, a second-year junior high school student, works part-time as a shrine maiden at Tenman Shrine in the city of Kamaya. Ever since being separated from her mother in early childhood, Matoi has been entrusted to her grandparents on her father's side, but three months ago, she finally began to live with her father Shingo. In those circumstances, she only wishes for a peaceful, normal life.<br/>Her close friend and part-time workmate Yuma Kusanagi is part of the family of the shrine's chief priest, and is a candidate to be the successor shrine maiden. For generations, her family has performed exorcisms of evil spirits. She invites Matoi to one of these exorcism ceremonies, a so-called "Divine Possession" that she will attempt.<br/><br/>One day, Matoi and Yuma walk from the school to the shrine as usual, but when they arrive, they are greeted by the shrine's now damaged grounds, and Yuma's parents have both collapsed from their wounds. Matoi's father Shingo, a police detective, launches an investigation, and he comes upon a man who does not seem entirely sane: his only witness. When he holds down the man, Yuma begins the ritual of Divine Possession.<br/><br/>Something strange then happens, not with Yuma, but with Matoi. Matoi Sumeragi, who had only wanted a normal, peaceful life, takes the role of a god, and gains the power to banish evil spirits! To get her precious everyday life back, Matoi must conduct exorcisms!<br/><br/>(Source: ANN)

This isn't a short, but a three episode OVA prequel in support of manga. It's a shame because I think this could be a really great full length series. It got me to pick up the manga so, again, it accomplished what it set out to do (provided they were actually selling the English translation...)
