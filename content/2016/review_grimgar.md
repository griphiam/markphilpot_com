[Hai to Gensou no Grimgar](https://hummingbird.me/anime/hai-to-gensou-no-grimgar) *Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash*

How far are you willing to go to ignore debilitating tropes if the core of the story is good? If the art and animation are spectacular will you give the unnecessary ecchi a pass?

This show was incredibly frustrating. I completely understand why many people never gave it a chance.

You have A-1 Pictures rolling out yet another "trapped in a virtual world"; Female characters given skimpy outfits for no reason other than fan service.

*However...*

Looking beyond the surface, there is something more than the sum of it's tropes. The "trapped in VR" is insinuated, but it's mostly used as a plot device to drop a group of people together without having to layout a backstory as to how they got there. This setup is given passing mention, but this is as far from *SAO*, *Log Horizon*, *Overlord* as you can get while still technically being in the same ballpark.

The fan service is less excusable, but it at least goes both ways and there are some empowered female characters and it definitely isn't a harem *cough* SAO *cough*.

From the opening two episodes, it quickly set itself apart from *SAO* (being probably its main source of similarity). When the party takes out a lone goblin, it doesn't just vanish. The goblin is obviously fighting for its life and its death is actually rather shocking -- to the point where I definitely felt empathy toward the foe (which never happened in *SAO*).

In the second episode, there is a 4 minute montage showing the day to day life of these characters, and I was surprised how powerful it was. It's something you would never see in any of its peers. This show is obviously about the characters and them getting to know each other and figuring out how to work together as a party.

The art and animation was spectacular. The backgrounds were soft, almost watercolor like. The character designs were solid and the fights while simplistic were well done.

The music was dominated by songs from *(K)NoW_NAME*
