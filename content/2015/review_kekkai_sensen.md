It's not often you see this pulled off at all. Bones wanted to do a double length final episode and apparently the station that was airing it wouldn't accommodate it. I have no idea if they had the final 40min episode ready since the conclusion of the spring season or if they've been working on it for 12 weeks, but final episode finally aired (albiet with Funimation taking a week or so after the airing it to put on their site).

Was the wait worth it?

## Story & Characters

## Animation

## Music & Sound

## Final Thoughts

Ultimately, I can't imaging them taking the current 12th episode and cutting it in half and doing the show justice.
