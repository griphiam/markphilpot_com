Summary: Anime that have made a grown man weep
status: draft

Any medium has the potential. So submerged in the story & characters you find yourself totally taken emotionally.

I'm not one of those "I cry at nothing" kind of guys. Certain things will definitely get me choked up by just the weight of the emotion involved -- even things that you wouldn't necessarily think would do so.  An example would be ESPN's [20th Century Montage](https://youtu.be/jlmxHvOWKB0?t=32). Even though it's entirely sports related, there are moments in that were I get choked up because of the sheer emotional punch those moments represent. Part of that is knowing the context and why, but that is beside the point for the current discussion.

There are a few *really* good anime shows where I was so tightly wound around the story and characters where I can say (without shame) that tears were shed -- and in one case caused me to openly bawl my eyes out for a good 20 minutes and even thinking about now causes tears to leak.

Below is collection of anime whose story and characters packed a huge emotional punch. While I will try not to spoil the punches too much, I recommend watching each of these with as little known before as possible. I can definitely recommend each and every one of the shows below, so you should go watch them first.

# Emotionally Choked Up

### Gakkou Gurashi!

The most recent show on this list is here because of its emotional range -- cute moe, fear, desperation, loss... It truly ran the gamut and that roller coaster made it's gut punches that much more effective.

### Toradora!

Christmas Eve. If you've seen this show, you know the scene I speak of.

### Angel Beats!
