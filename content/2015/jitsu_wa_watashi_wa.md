I almost missed this gem of a show. I watched the first 5 minutes of the first episode and dismissed it. The weird (yet distinctive) character designs didn't help. I thought it was going to be just another ecchi, harem show with monster & alien girls (a la [Rosario + Vampire](https://hummingbird.me/anime/rosario-vampire)).

For some reason, I didn't remove it from my Crunchyroll queue... it just sat there, ignored for the remainder of the summer season.

I don't know what caused me to try watching the first episode again, but I'm *so* glad I did. For me, this show ticked off most of the things I want to see in a romantic comedy and it quickly become one of my favorites.
