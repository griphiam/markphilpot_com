Summary: Retrospective of the Summer 2015 Anime Season
status: draft

Welcome to my first attempt at an anime season retrospective. Some ground rules before we get started.

__No Spoilers__ <br/> Retrospectives will be to give a sense of what I thought of a show in case you didn't catch it. Eventually, I'll have dedicated posts to reviewing specific shows that will have spoilers.

__Subject to Change__ <br/> By the time I get around to a show's individual review, my opinion might have changed. I'm not planning on retconning these posts to necessarily match.

With that out of the way, I'm sorry this will come in a bit late as I'm still working out the kinks.

## Overall

Wow. While I haven following anime that long, this summer season easily goes down as one of the best. While there weren't any all-time great shows, the breadth that we got was astonishing. Great stories and great characters up and down the lineup.

I love this show with a huge caveat :: I will be absolutely crushed if this never gets a second season. Everything about this show was excellent; from the catchy OP (*Renegade* by STEREO DRIVE FOUNDATION), to the characters, to the soundtrack... I'm giving it full marks with the **assumption** there will be a second season. While the ending didn't feel like a traditional "read the manga" ending, there has been no word to date on any follow on work.

If you enjoyed [Black Lagoon]() then I highly recommend this one.
