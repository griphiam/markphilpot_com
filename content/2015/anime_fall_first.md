Summary: First Impressions of the Anime Fall 2015 Season

So this is my inaugural anime post that I really meant to do for the Summer season but due to vacations wasn't able to do.  I still hope to do a Summer 2015 retrospective at some point because it really was an excellent season. My plan right now is to try to do two posts a season: a First Impressions post that covers the first episode or two of the shows I'm going to try to watch, and a Retrospective post covering the shows I enjoyed and the reasons why I dropped others.

By way of introduction, I use [Hummingbird](https://hummingbird.me) to keep tabs on by anime "todo" list and you can follow me [here](https://hummingbird.me/users/mphilpot). The interface is by far superior to [MAL](http://myanimelist.net) which is probably a post in and of itself.

[One Punch Man](https://hummingbird.me/anime/one-punch-man) <br/> If you go based on the hype, this is the only show of the season.  Having never heard of the manga before the anime crossed my radar, I really knew nothing of this other than the single line synopsis.  I've been a fan of Madhouse's most recent work ([Death Parade](https://hummingbird.me/anime/death-parade), [Ore Monogatari!!](https://hummingbird.me/anime/ore-monogatari)) the last few seasons so I was looking forward to seeing what the type was about.  An episode in, I have high hopes.

The animation is fantastic (almost like Madhouse got together with Trigger) and I really like the OP. I just have no idea where the show will go with the story.  Episode 1 was a basic introduction, and I'm hoping the show is more than a villian-of-the-week formula.

__*Verdict* :: Binge if I could__

![Heavy Object TODO]({filename}/images/anime/2015/fall/heavyobject_pv.jpg "Heavy Object"){: .center}
![JC Staff]({filename}/images/anime/studios/jc_staff.png "JC Staff"){: .center}

[Heavy Object](https://hummingbird.me/anime/heavy-object) <br/> Going into this season, I was genuinely excited for this one. The writer is Kazuma Kamachi, writer of [Toaru Majutsu no Index](https://hummingbird.me/anime/toaru-majutsu-no-index) and [Toaru Kagaku no Railgun](https://hummingbird.me/anime/toaru-kagaku-no-railgun), two shows I throughly enjoyed. After episode 1?  Meh?

Granted the first episode was heavy on backstory, but just found myself especially bored by the conflict and the characters felt completely flat. Contrast this with the characters from Railgun who I fell in love with almost immediately.  I'll get through the 3 episode rule with this one, but it might not get beyond that.

__*Verdict* :: 3 Episode Rule Jeopardy__

![Trigger]({filename}/images/anime/studios/trigger.png "Trigger"){: .center}

[Hacka Doll The Animation](https://hummingbird.me/anime/hacka-doll-the-animation) <br/> The only reason this is on anyone's radar for this season is the studio attached to it.  I loved [Kill la Kill](http://) and was really hoping for more [Little Witch Academia](http://) (no, I haven't had a chance yet to watch the [movie](http://)). But oh boy does this seem like a wasted effort. I guess the only saving grace is that it truly does turn out to be a dud, it was only a series of shorts.

![White Fox]({filename}/images/anime/studios/white_fox.png "White Fox"){: .center}

[Utawarerumono: Itsuwari No Kamen](https://hummingbird.me/anime/utawarerumono-itsuwari-no-kamen) <br/> File this under "complete unknown" and "somewhat promising." I actually appreciate that the show just drops in the audience without explaining any of context of the world the protagonist finds himself in (unlike some other shows I could name *cough* Heavy Object *cough*). My one gripe is that its a continuation of a lazy (but theoretically competant) male lead. It really would be nice to have a show with this tone that was gender flipped.  The saving grace is that the female supporting character seems like the "sweet but kick-ass type" -- I hope anyway.

__*Verdict* :: Hoping to enjoy__

![Asterisk]({filename}/images/anime/2015/fall/gakusen_pv.jpg "Asterisk"){: .center}
![A1]({filename}/images/anime/studios/a1.png "A1"){: .center}

[Gakusen Toshi Asterisk](https://hummingbird.me/anime/gakusen-toshi-asterisk) <br/> Why must the Japanese always ruin perfectly good shows with meaningless sexual overtones, peeping toms, and just all around crapy sexual tropes? I really want to take a show like this and put it on the editing block and see if a genuinely good show comes out of it. I think underneath all that crap there might be a half way decent story to be told here, but my guess is they ruin it by pushing the unnecessary sexual tropes to 11.

![Rakudai]({filename}/images/anime/2015/fall/rakudai_pv.jpg "Rakudai"){: .center}<br/>
[Silver Link](http://){: .center .link-nb}

[Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry](https://hummingbird.me/anime/rakudai-kishi-no-cavalry) <br/> What. The. *Hell*?! You could literally run Asterisk and Cavalry side by side, and *literally* they would be identical.  Shot for Shot.  Hell, even the dialog could have ben copied. I just happened to watch these two back to back and had to stop and check that I hadn't accidently played the same episode twice. *Mind Blown*

Once again, theoretically a decent story underneath the tropes, but I have almost no hope that there will be a shift in tone for the better.

[Lance Nâ€™ Masques](https://hummingbird.me/anime/lance-n-masques) <br/> Think Medieval Superman.

![Concrete Revolutio]({filename}/images/anime/2015/fall/concrete_pv.jpg "Concrete Revolutio"){: .center}
![Bones]({filename}/images/anime/studios/bones.png "Bones"){: .center}

[Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou](https://hummingbird.me/anime/concrete-revolutio-choujin-gensou) <br/> What do you get when you cross [Kekkai Sensen](https://hummingbird.me/anime/kekkai-sensen) with [Rolling Girls](https://hummingbird.me/anime/the-rolling-girls)? I'm not exactly sure either, but Concrete Revolutio would be my best guess. Unlike Kekkai Sensen, I wasn't immediately sucked into the world being built and it was hard to get a sense of the characters. I'll definitely give it a few more episodes, but considering how long we've waited for Kekkai Sensen's final episode, I feel like Bones doesn't get any free passes on this one.

__*Verdict* :: Could be destined for a holding pattern...__

[Haikyuu 2](https://hummingbird.me/anime/haikyuu-2) <br/> Like with [Baby Steps 2 TODO](http://) in the spring, I stumbled into a sports anime which I never thought I'd watch.  However, the enthusiasm fans seem to have for this show made me curious so I went back and started with the first season; and I'm very glad I did.  Where as Baby Steps has a single protagonist (because of the sport... but wouldn't you like to see a spin-off with mixed doubles?), this seems like it will be more team dynamics focused which could open a lot of avenues for interesting story telling.  I do think I'm going to miss having any women in the supporting cast (or hell, it might have been better focusing on a women's volleyball team), but only time will tell where they end up going.  All in all, I'm very glad I decided to give season 1 a try and will be making my way through.

__*Verdict* :: Currently binging Season 1 to catch up__
