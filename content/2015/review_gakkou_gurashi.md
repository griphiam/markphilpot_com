## Summary

I understand the difficulties in generating a synopsis for a show like this. I'm assuming [Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica]() had the same issue: how to let people know not to completely judge the show based on the promotion material.  However, that being said I have a bone to pick.

Here's the synopsis from ANN:

> The story revolves around four girls who decide to stay over at school: the energetic Yuki Takeya, the shovel-loving Rumi, the center of the group Rurii who brings everyone together, and the spacey school adviser Megu. However, through mysterious circumstances, the girls find themselves the final survivors in a zombie attack, and continue to live at the school.

What the hell? To me, that's the equivalent of a synopsis for Star Wars spoiling Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father (and if I just spoiled that for you... I'm impressed you've spent this long on the Internet without knowing that).

Let's compare that to Madoka Magica's synopsis:

> She has a loving family and best friends, laughs and cries from time to time... Madoka Kaname, an eighth grader of Mitakihara middle school, is one of those who lives such a life. One day, she had a very magical encounter. She doesn't know if it happened by chance or by fate yet. This is a fateful encounter that can change her destiny—this is a beginning of the new story of the magical girls.

You already know it's a magical girl show, so this synopsis doesn't spoil anything. It means the true nature of the show gets spread by word of mouth (doesn't hurt that you have Gen Urobuchi as the lead writer).

Anyway, back to Gakkou. Thankfully there are more twists and turns throughout the show that surprised everyone, the fact that the post-apocalyptic setting was spoiled for most people wasn't a complete detriment.

The opening was a fantastic contrast to the dark nature of the show. The first five seconds of the song drop a hint before the happy melody takes over, and then after the first episode, the destruction beginning to seep through. I thought it was brilliantly done.

I also loved that they changed up the ending songs to really add punch to the final scene of the episode.

Finally, a special shout out for the sound design when the zombies are on screen. Combined with the visual obscurity, the darkness and zombies gave weight to how scary this situation would be.
