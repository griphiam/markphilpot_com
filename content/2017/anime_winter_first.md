Seriously.

Anyway... Welcome to 2017.

You'll probably notice that this first impressions post is coming out a bit later than usual (and probably before the fall retrospective). First, I had a few shows from last season I wanted to finish off before diving into this one. Second, with hummingbird.me transitioning to kitsu.io, my bootstrap script that helps me put this post together became OBE. After a bit of research, I switched over to a very good API provided by [anilist.co](https://anilist.co) -- and to be honest, I'm *this* close to switching my anime tracking to anilist full time (my profile is [here](https://anilist.co/user/mphilpot/animelist)) (*Update:* Done and done).

### [Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2](https://anilist.co/anime/21699)

Season 1 came out of nowhere and for many was the best show of 2016 (and easily the best comedy). I'm a *little* concerned about what they have planned this time around. It was clear they didn't know what they had the first time, so I hope they don't end up ruining it because of the unexpected popularity.

### [Masamune-kun no Revenge](https://anilist.co/anime/21857)

There are a few ways this one could go. I feel it's a bit like a Monty Hall problem -- we could very easily end up with a goat. The opening wasn't half bad, but we'll have to give it a few more episodes to prove itself. The show seemingly avoided a few pitfalls in it's debut and managed to make the two main characters slightly more than one dimensional. Fingers crossed?

What. The Hell. Did I Just Watch.

I will give it at least one more episode, but I'm not sure I can get over the rather unfortunate character designs. The overall animation didn't strike me as great either (although I was too distracted by the characters to really take notice). A season after another medocre war anime in [Izetta](http://anilist.co/anime/21838/ShuumatsunoIzetta) I sincerely doubt I'll be up for this one.

### [Fuuka](https://anilist.co/anime/21887)

I almost passed this one by, but Crunchyroll picked it up, so I thought I'd give the first episode a chance. It was ever-so *slightly* endearing, even if it does roll out a whole slew of tropes and fan service. I'm really hoping there is more to the story and characters that what we see on the surface, but I won't be surprised if we continue a mediocre romcom plot with needless fan service and an abundance of tropes.

He becomes embroiled in an incident during which he pulls out a holy sword embedded in a rock and ends up becoming a Shepherd, one who casts away calamity from the world.<br/>He begins to realize the gravity of his mission, and his dream of coexistence between mankind and the seraphim becomes more intense—<br><br><br/><br/>And thus, the Shepherd embarks on a journey with his companions.<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: Official Website)

### [ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka](https://anilist.co/anime/21823)

> The kingdom of Dowa, which is subdivided into 13 states, is celebrating its monarch's 99th birthday. These 13 states have many agencies that are controlled by the giant organization known as ACCA. Within ACCA, Jean Otis is the second-in-command of the inspection agency. His agency has ten people placed in each of the 13 states, with a central office in the capital city. They keep track of all the activities of ACCA across the kingdom, and keep data on each state's ACCA office flowing toward the central office. Jean also often has business trips from the capital to the other districts to check on the situation and personnel there.<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: MangaHelpers)

### [Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen](https://anilist.co/anime/21733)

Last year's first season was anime of the year in my opinion. Not everyone's cup of tea, but it was just *so good* at what it set out to do. I'm even more excited for this cour since (hopefully) will be focusing on the new student, *Yotaro*.

From the staff who brought us [Amagami SS](http://anilist.co/anime/8676/AmagamiSS) (if not the studio). I honestly rather enjoyed Amagami, but I'm going to at least wait so I can binge each heroine's arc rather than waiting week to week.

### [Demi-chan wa Kataritai](https://anilist.co/anime/97592)

Ok, this one is going to my not-so-secret favorite of the season. Heartwarming & cute -- this one fills the feel good role that [Flying Witch](http://anilist.co/anime/21284/flyingwitch) and [Sweetness and Lightning](http://anilist.co/manga/86044/AmaamatoInazuma) filled last year. I couldn't help but smile throughout the entire first episode. Kudos to A1 if they can pull this one off.

### [Urara Meirochou](https://anilist.co/anime/21696)

> The story is set in Meiro-chou, a town where all-female diviners (uranaishi) live and where girls from all over the country yearn to become the top diviner — "Urara." Today, a solitary girl named Chiya enters the town's gates. However, she has another purpose coming here, besides becoming the Urara. Chiya's days as an apprentice diviner begin as she meets three friends — the earnest Kon, Koume who is a fan of Western culture, and the shy Nono.<br><br><br/>(Source: ANN)

### [Kobayashi-san Chi no Maidragon](https://anilist.co/anime/21776)

> Miss Kobayashi is your average office worker who lives a boring life, alone in her small apartment–until she saves the life of a female dragon in distress. The dragon, named Tohru, has the ability to magically transform into an adorable human girl (albeit with horns and a long tail!), who will do anything to pay off her debt of gratitude, whether Miss Kobayashi likes it or not. With a very persistent and amorous dragon as a roommate, nothing comes easy, and Miss Kobayashi's normal life is about to go off the deep end!<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)

### [Gabriel DropOut](https://anilist.co/anime/21878)

There is going to be some comedy gold in this one. I'm a sucker for the timing employed in this one, which feels much more like a anime short than a full length show. I never saw [Himouto! Umaru-Chan](http://anilist.co/anime/20987/HIMOUTOUMARUCHAN) a few seasons ago, but this feels a bit like I imagine that one would be (just in a slightly reverse fashion... almost like [Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://anilist.co/anime/15809/HatarakuMaousama) (*Devil is a Part-Timer*)).
