Seriously.

Anyway... Welcome to 2017.

You'll probably notice that this first impressions post is coming out a bit later than usual (and probably before the fall retrospective). First, I had a few shows from last season I wanted to finish off before diving into this one. Second, with hummingbird.me transitioning to kitsu.io, my bootstrap script that helps me put this post together became OBE. After a bit of research, I switched over to a very good API provided by [anilist.co](https://anilist.co) -- and to be honest, I'm *this* close to switching my anime tracking to anilist full time (my profile is [here](https://anilist.co/user/mphilpot/animelist)) (*Update:* Done and done).

My first impression of this season seems to be *understated* but *solid*. There is a wide variety with comedies taking the lead. With the holidays I fell behind last season, so I'll be playing catch up and hopefully try to stay more current for this one.

One "shocking" bit of news before we dive in is Amazon's new pay-for anime channel called [Anime Strike](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-12/amazon-u.s-launches-anime-strike-paid-streaming-service/.110924) as part of their paid streaming service. I don't know what to think of this -- to say their catalog is bare bones is significantly understating the situation. As a happy paying subscriber of Crunchyroll, Funimation & Netflix, I'm not sure I dive into this one unless they start buying up enough shows to really deprive CR. Will be interesting to see what shows they pick up this coming year. If I had to bet, I'd say they might go aggressively after [Shingeki no Kyojin 2](http://anilist.co/anime/20958/ShingekinoKyojin2) as an exclusive. That would be quite the steal.

Anyway, let's dive in...

### [Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2](https://anilist.co/anime/21699)

Season 1 came out of nowhere and for many was the best show of 2016 (and easily the best comedy). I'm a *little* concerned about what they have planned this time around. It was clear they didn't know what they had the first time, so I hope they don't end up ruining it because of the unexpected popularity.

### [Masamune-kun no Revenge](https://anilist.co/anime/21857)

There are a few ways this one could go. I feel it's a bit like a Monty Hall problem -- we could very easily end up with a goat. The opening wasn't half bad, but we'll have to give it a few more episodes to prove itself. The show seemingly avoided a few pitfalls in it's debut and managed to make the two main characters slightly more than one dimensional. Fingers crossed?

![Trigger]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/trigger.png){: .studio}

### [Little Witch Academia (TV)](https://anilist.co/anime/21858)

Netflix suposedly has picked this up, but I can't find definite confirmation. I thought the short and movie were fun and entertaining in a very Trigger-like way.

![Lerche]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/lerche.png){: .studio}

### [Kuzu no Honkai](https://anilist.co/anime/21701)

I have reservations with this one. I managed to figure out that "Oni-chan" in this instance is just a family friend rather than her actual brother, but it's hard to dispell the thought given Japan's propencity for that story line. I thought the animation style was nice and different. The use of split screen and overall editing style was actually really refreshing. My worry is that this will have the possibility for an absolute crushing ending. There are very few "happy" resolutions for a plot started this way. Like [orange](http://anilist.co/anime/21647/orange) last year, I may have to stay away until I figure out what kind of ending it has for my own emotional sanity.

### [Youjo Senki](https://anilist.co/anime/21613)

What. The Hell. Did I Just Watch.

I will give it at least one more episode, but I'm not sure I can get over the rather unfortunate character designs. The overall animation didn't strike me as great either (although I was too distracted by the characters to really take notice). A season after another medocre war anime in [Izetta](http://anilist.co/anime/21838/ShuumatsunoIzetta) I sincerely doubt I'll be up for this one.

### [Fuuka](https://anilist.co/anime/21887)

I almost passed this one by, but Crunchyroll picked it up, so I thought I'd give the first episode a chance. It was ever-so *slightly* endearing, even if it does roll out a whole slew of tropes and fan service. I'm really hoping there is more to the story and characters that what we see on the surface, but I won't be surprised if we continue a mediocre romcom plot with needless fan service and an abundance of tropes.

### [Tales of Zestiria the X 2](https://anilist.co/anime/97645)

> The second season of Tales of Zestiria the X.<br><br><br/><br/>Sorey is a human youth who grew up among the seraphim, spiritual beings not visible to humans.<br/>Sorey believes in the folklore that says “long ago, every human was able to see the seraphim" and dreams of unraveling the ancient mystery to make the world a place where people and seraphim can live together in peace.<br><br><br/><br/>One day, Sorey visits the human capital for the very first time. He becomes embroiled in an incident during which he pulls out a holy sword embedded in a rock and ends up becoming a Shepherd, one who casts away calamity from the world.<br/>He begins to realize the gravity of his mission, and his dream of coexistence between mankind and the seraphim becomes more intense—<br><br><br/><br/>And thus, the Shepherd embarks on a journey with his companions.<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: Official Website)

### [ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka](https://anilist.co/anime/21823)

> The kingdom of Dowa, which is subdivided into 13 states, is celebrating its monarch's 99th birthday. These 13 states have many agencies that are controlled by the giant organization known as ACCA. Within ACCA, Jean Otis is the second-in-command of the inspection agency. His agency has ten people placed in each of the 13 states, with a central office in the capital city. They keep track of all the activities of ACCA across the kingdom, and keep data on each state's ACCA office flowing toward the central office. Jean also often has business trips from the capital to the other districts to check on the situation and personnel there.<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: MangaHelpers)

### [Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen](https://anilist.co/anime/21733)

Last year's first season was anime of the year in my opinion. Not everyone's cup of tea, but it was just *so good* at what it set out to do. I'm even more excited for this cour since (hopefully) will be focusing on the new student, *Yotaro*.

### [Seiren](https://anilist.co/anime/97730)

From the staff who brought us [Amagami SS](http://anilist.co/anime/8676/AmagamiSS) (if not the studio). I honestly rather enjoyed Amagami, but I'm going to at least wait so I can binge each heroine's arc rather than waiting week to week.

![A1]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/a1.png){: .studio}

### [Demi-chan wa Kataritai](https://anilist.co/anime/97592)

Ok, this one is going to my not-so-secret favorite of the season. Heartwarming & cute -- this one fills the feel good role that [Flying Witch](http://anilist.co/anime/21284/flyingwitch) and [Sweetness and Lightning](http://anilist.co/manga/86044/AmaamatoInazuma) filled last year. I couldn't help but smile throughout the entire first episode. Kudos to A1 if they can pull this off.

![Kyoto]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/kyoto.png){: .studio}

### [Kobayashi-san Chi no Maidragon](https://anilist.co/anime/21776)

This one got quite a few chuckles out of me. It feels like an anime short in the body of a full length series. Episodic hyjinx, here we come.

![Dogakobo]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/dogakobo.png){: .studio}

### [Gabriel DropOut](https://anilist.co/anime/21878)

There is going to be some comedy gold in this one. I never saw [Himouto! Umaru-Chan](http://anilist.co/anime/20987/HIMOUTOUMARUCHAN) a few seasons ago, but this feels a bit like I imagine that one would be (just in a slightly reverse fashion... almost like [Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://anilist.co/anime/15809/HatarakuMaousama) (*Devil is a Part-Timer*)).
