### [Hibike! Euphonium 2](https://hummingbird.me/anime/hibike-euphonium-2)

For some reason, I decided early on that I wanted to binge *Eupho*. I had watched the first cour well after it had finished airing and ended up binge watching it over a few days.

### [Yuri!!! on Ice](https://hummingbird.me/anime/yuri-on-ice)

The strong opening episode really caught me off guard. The comedic timing was superb and there was a level of confidence and sincerity exuding from the show that really hooks you in while the comedy acknowledges not to take the show too seriously. It was a fantastic combination. Give this show a chance even if you would initial balk at the subject. I don't think you will regret it.

*Sigh*

I was actually rather enjoying the opening episode right up until the witch Izetta *mounted* the rifle as if it was a broom and started flying. That rather unfortunate shot to the system got me to realize all the other flaws and suddenly I wasn't quite as interested. I will still give this one a few more episodes but frankly I don't have high hopes for this.

### [Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari](https://hummingbird.me/anime/udon-no-kuni-no-kiniro-kemari)

Literally [Sweetness & Lightning](https://hummingbird.me/anime/amaama-to-inazuma) meets [Usagi Drop](https://hummingbird.me/anime/bunny-drop). I have my doubts that this will be anywhere near as good as S&L. Apparently death, food and a cute kid are a winning combination. I'll stick this one out as long as they keep a good level of character development going.

### [Gi(a)rlish Number](https://hummingbird.me/anime/girlish-number)

Wow. Not at all what I expected. There is quite a lot of not so subtle ribbing going on here. This one feels like [Shirobako](https://hummingbird.me/anime/shirobako)'s evil twin taking the whole experience down a few notches. Let's see where this one goes.

### [Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku](https://hummingbird.me/anime/mahou-shoujo-ikusei-keikaku)

How much will this just be an inferior clone of [Madoka Magica](https://hummingbird.me/anime/mahou-shoujo-madoka-magica)? I hope it's more than that, but I have my worries. There could be lots of room to play around with this as long as they have the confidence to break out of Madoka's shadow. Not sure if this original or an adaption (not that it really matters, just curious more than anything). Hopefully we get to see a new side of a *Mahou Shoujo* turned on its head rather than yet another exploitive magical girl torture porn series.

### [Fune wo Amu](https://hummingbird.me/anime/fune-wo-amu)

A very unusual premise -- creating a new dictionary. The protagonist's voice actor is [Takahiro Sakurai](https://myanimelist.net/people/79/Takahiro_Sakurai) who as literally been in *everything* (Jesus... what a resume). I have no idea if I'll keep this one up. If the main focus is the *dictionary* then I'll probably pass. If the dictionary is the device to tell some stories about these characters, then I think I could get on board.

### [Flip Flappers](https://hummingbird.me/anime/flip-flappers)

In my first impressions post I thought this might be the gem of the season and wow was I understating that. The animation... There were so many moments where my jaw was on the floor watching the visual spectacle. Very different than say the styles of KyoAni or ufotable.

Cute and Fun. Definitely give this one a click.
