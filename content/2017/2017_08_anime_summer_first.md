### [No Game No Life -Zero-](https://anilist.co/anime/21875)

It took me a while to figure out that Vol 6 was actually a prequel story about the world of *Disboard*. The original anime was only an adaptation of Volumes 1 and 2.

*Sigh*

I still want a continuation, but I guess I'll have to settle for this. It's at least Madhouse.

### [Katsugeki Touken Ranbu](https://anilist.co/anime/21742)

Not being familiar *at all* with Touken Ranbu the game, I went into this story cold -- I mean it's ufotable, which means there was no way I wouldn't give it a shot. Doesn't disappoint. Great fight sequences, groundwork for some good character dynamics, and the hinting of orchestrated conflict sells it for me.
