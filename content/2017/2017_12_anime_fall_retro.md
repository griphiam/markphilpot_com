[TOC]

So Persona 5 completely derailed my keeping up with the fall season. Thankfully this season has sort of a built in buffer with the holidays at the end and most winter anime not starting until the first of the year -- I've been able to binge most of shows I wanted to keep up with. Looking back on this year, I wasn't able to post many individual series reviews (read: none) and want to pick that up again going into 2018 (along with more blogging in general, even if it's just to keep my already limited writing ability from completely hitting rock bottom again). There were a number of shows this year (especialy in this fall season) that I'm hoping to talk about in more detail.

### [Mahoutsukai no Yome](https://anilist.co/anime/98436)

Quick thought since it's only halfway through: _LOVE!!_

It's like you never left...

This was a very rapid reintroduction to the world of Hellsalem's Lot, but I must say I had a smile on my face the entire time.

Welcome back Leonardo...

A few notes:

1. The kids and wife are assholes
2. We don't deserve dogs
3. ... _Interesting?_ ...
4. Nice to hear a _Man with a Mission_ OP again

I feel like this was an episode 0 -- the origin story if you will -- and that we'll get a better idea of the show in the next two episodes. I was encouraged to read (after the fact) that the VA for the MC is a 68 year old.

A dark _Battle Royale_ that doesn't seem to be afraid to not pull punches?

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: -50px;"><small class="caption-text muted">Well
if you insist</small></div>

This should be entertaining if the ending of the first episode is the start of a trend line.

### [Just Because!](https://anilist.co/anime/98820)

I have high hopes for this one and the first episode didn't let me down. From the studio that gave us [Gamers!](https://anilist.co/anime/97766) last season I think this has tremendous potential because they aren't restricted to the comedy genre. The episode is slow but I loved the honesty in all the characters (see my first reaction to _Gamers!_... same thoughts). As long as they don't manufacture a bunch of overlapping relationship triangles and just focus on these characters interacting, this could be the gem of the season.

### [Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - the Animated Series](https://anilist.co/anime/98448)

I haven't seen the original, but know that many love this show. The first episode was I think a great intro to this episodic series (part of me wonders if there will be any sort of modern take of an arc). For a moment there I thought this was done by A1...

### [Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau](https://anilist.co/anime/98449)

Hmmm... The premise seems interesting. I like the art style and character designs...

Oh wait.

_DAMN IT NETFLIX_

### [Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou](https://anilist.co/anime/99420)

This was a very interesting juxtaposition between cute and unsettling. The scene with the rations and the gun... Ugh, wow. If the music had made a bigger impact, it truly would have been great opening episode.

### [Houseki no Kuni](https://anilist.co/anime/98707)

I'm going to go into this one with an open mind. While I still think this would be better hand drawn, the full CGI treatment isn't an immediate disqualification -- they at least picked the right story/characters to do it with CGI -- Anthropomorphize gemstones.

There could be some very interesting world building here, so I'm going to stick around and see if my interest is rewarded. The one gripe I will air is the eyes in the characters. It's the one key aspect that anime can utilize to its full extent and I feel like the eyes are a let down with these characters -- they feel flat and unexpressive.

It's the eyes. Nail that and it will cover a lot of other imperfections.

This one has the potential to be a favorite of the season. The MC is really endearing even if the pacing was a tad rough around the edges.

### [Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte Kara](https://anilist.co/anime/98657)

This 3 minute short is too short for it's own good. I'm skeptical it will win me over as throughly as [Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/20735) did, but I'm willing to give it a chance.

### [Konohana Kitan](https://anilist.co/anime/98506)

Oh good lord is this shit cute.

If it's anywhere close to the feel good comfort that was [Non Non Biyori](https://anilist.co/anime/17549) I'll be very happy.

### [Anime-Gataris](https://anilist.co/anime/98607)

Initially reminded me of _Gamers!_ and then there was a very weird turn at the end. Another show that will take a few episodes to sort everything out.

Trying to follow all the references was fun.
