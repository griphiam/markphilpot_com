[TOC]

So Persona 5 completely derailed my keeping up with the fall season. Thankfully this season has sort of a built in buffer with the holidays at the end and most winter anime not starting until the first of the year -- I've been able to binge most of shows I wanted to keep up with. Looking back on this year, I wasn't able to post many individual series reviews (read: none) and want to pick that up again going into 2018 (along with more blogging in general, even if it's just to keep my already limited writing ability from completely hitting rock bottom again). There were a number of shows this year (especialy in this fall season) that I'm hoping to talk about in more detail.

Quick thought since it's only halfway through: _LOVE!!_

It's like you never left...

This was a very rapid reintroduction to the world of Hellsalem's Lot, but I must say I had a smile on my face the entire time.

Welcome back Leonardo...

A few notes:

1. The kids and wife are assholes
2. We don't deserve dogs
3. ... _Interesting?_ ...
4. Nice to hear a _Man with a Mission_ OP again

I feel like this was an episode 0 -- the origin story if you will -- and that we'll get a better idea of the show in the next two episodes. I was encouraged to read (after the fact) that the VA for the MC is a 68 year old.

For the sake of this initial discussion let's ignore the ED.

Not bad. Spoilers, but the ending felt a bit of a cheat, but it was acknowledged as such, so I'm willing to give it a pass. I liked that no character had plot armor, but the consequence was that we didn't get to know or sympathize with any of the characters outside of a single episode back-story-flashback.

Quick note on that ED. Good lord, someone should be fired for approving that storyboard. Good song though.

### [Just Because!](https://anilist.co/anime/98820)

I have high hopes for this one and the first episode didn't let me down. From the studio that gave us [Gamers!](https://anilist.co/anime/97766) last season I think this has tremendous potential because they aren't restricted to the comedy genre. The episode is slow but I loved the honesty in all the characters (see my first reaction to _Gamers!_... same thoughts). As long as they don't manufacture a bunch of overlapping relationship triangles and just focus on these characters interacting, this could be the gem of the season.

### [Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - the Animated Series](https://anilist.co/anime/98448)

I haven't seen the original, but know that many love this show. The first episode was I think a great intro to this episodic series (part of me wonders if there will be any sort of modern take of an arc). For a moment there I thought this was done by A1...

### [Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau](https://anilist.co/anime/98449)

Hmmm... The premise seems interesting. I like the art style and character designs...

Oh wait.

_DAMN IT NETFLIX_

### [Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou](https://anilist.co/anime/99420)

This was a very interesting juxtaposition between cute and unsettling. The scene with the rations and the gun... Ugh, wow. If the music had made a bigger impact, it truly would have been great opening episode.

### [Houseki no Kuni](https://anilist.co/anime/98707)

Outside of Mahoutsukai no Yome this was easily anime of the season for me -- and that's shocking for me to say given its CG anime. The story was _so_ good and they really used the _CG_ to their storytelling advantage rather than a gimmick. [Tomoyo Kurosawa](https://anilist.co/staff/106661/TomoyoKurosawa) is absolutely stunning as Phosphophyllite (and really channels her sarcastic "Kumiko Oumae" perfectly).

Don't let the CG be a deterrent from experiencing this show (also don't judge by the first two episodes alone... there is a noticeable improvement in their CG craft by episode 5 or 6)

Don't get me wrong -- I loved this show. I loved the MC. Fantastic all around. Highly recommend.

At some point, _someone_ has to give us a romcom that doesn't center around near debilitating shyness/awkwardness. Can't they just genuinely like each other and move incrementally forward? Essentially, I want this plot with the seriousness of [Tsuki ga Kirei](https://anilist.co/anime/98202/TsukigaKirei).

### [Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte Kara](https://anilist.co/anime/98657)

This 3 minute short is too short for it's own good. I'm skeptical it will win me over as throughly as [Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/20735) did, but I'm willing to give it a chance.

### [Konohana Kitan](https://anilist.co/anime/98506)

There was some genuine excellent story telling in this one. It's a shame they were obviously doing this on a shoe-string budget. The sheer percentage of single frame image set to music was absurd with this show. I would still recommend, but just keep that in mind going into it.

I have to say however, the last episode truly nails the ending for the show. _That_ is how you wrap a show.

### [Anime-Gataris](https://anilist.co/anime/98607)

Initially reminded me of _Gamers!_ and then there was a very weird turn at the end. Another show that will take a few episodes to sort everything out.

Trying to follow all the references was fun.
