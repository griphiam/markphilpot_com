Seriously.

Anyway... Welcome to 2017.

You'll probably notice that this first impressions post is coming out a bit later than usual (and probably before the fall retrospective). First, I had a few shows from last season I wanted to finish off before diving into this one. Second, with hummingbird.me transitioning to kitsu.io, my bootstrap script that helps me put this post together became OBE. After a bit of research, I switched over to a very good API provided by [anilist.co](https://anilist.co) -- and to be honest, I'm *this* close to switching my anime tracking to anilist full time (my profile is [here](https://anilist.co/user/mphilpot/animelist)) (*Update:* Done and done).

### [Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2](https://anilist.co/anime/21699)

Season 1 came out of nowhere and for many was the best show of 2016 (and easily the best comedy). I'm a *little* concerned about what they have planned this time around. It was clear they didn't know what they had the first time, so I hope they don't end up ruining it because of the unexpected popularity.

There are a few ways this one could go. I feel it's a bit like a Monty Hall problem -- we could very easily end up with a goat. The opening wasn't half bad, but we'll have to give it a few more episodes to prove itself.

What. The Hell. Did I Just Watch.

Despite the character designs, I'm slightly intreagued after the first episode reveal at the end. There are quite a few interesting ways this could go, and it probably won't go down any of those.

I almost passed this one by. Based on the description, I completely guessed wrong on what I thought it was going to be. The first episode is endeering, even if it does roll out a whole slew of tropes and fan service. I'm really hoping there is more to the story and characters, and I think I'm willing to give it a shot.

Within ACCA, Jean Otis is the second-in-command of the inspection agency. His agency has ten people placed in each of the 13 states, with a central office in the capital city. They keep track of all the activities of ACCA across the kingdom, and keep data on each state's ACCA office flowing toward the central office. Jean also often has business trips from the capital to the other districts to check on the situation and personnel there.<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: MangaHelpers)

### [Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen](https://anilist.co/anime/21733)

Last year's first season was anime of the year in my opinion. Not everyone's cup of tea, but it was just *so good* at what it set out to do. I'm even more excited for this cour since (hopefully) will be focusing on the new student, *Yotaro*.

Ok, this one is going to my not-so-secret favorite of the season. Heartwarming & cute -- this one fills the feel good role that [Flying Witch]() and [Sweetness and Lightning]() filled last year.
