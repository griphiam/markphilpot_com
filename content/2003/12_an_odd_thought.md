I just came to a rather random conclusion.  The reason why Linux will eventually win in the end over Microsoft, is that Linux has a cool mascot.  Tux the penguin is just so much cooler than "Clippy" the paperclip.  There's just no contest.

This deep thought has been brought to you by the letters F, G, L and the number 7.
