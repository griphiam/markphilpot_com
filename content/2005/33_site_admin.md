So I actually have been doing a bunch of work on the site.  The main area hasn't been updated because the menu system I use (<a href="http://www.likno.com">allwebmenus</a>) hasn't responded to my email about a link to their v3 software (which I paid for).  They only have v4, which I haven't (and didn't want to) upgrade to.  Personally, I think it is incredibly disingenous.  Hopefully they get back to me soon and don't try to stiff me.
