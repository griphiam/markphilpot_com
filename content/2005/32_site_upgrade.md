I have been upgrading all the software the runs on my site (<a href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net">Gallery</a>, <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://www.phpbb.com">phpBB2</a>), so I thought I'd give this another shot.  Wordpress now has lots of nifty spam plugins, so hopefully that problem will go away so I can actually enjoy using this stuff.  We'll see how long it lasts once again.  I doubt many people are reading this anyway, but I enjoy putting thoughts down when I can.
