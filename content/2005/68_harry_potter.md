<p>Quick and dirty: If you've seen the other 3 films, this one is <span style="font-style: italic;">much</span> better.&nbsp; I give Mike Newel a lot of credit.&nbsp; There is a lot of material to cover and he did it very well (I'll touch on that later).&nbsp; Great start to what looks like an excellent few weeks of movies.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Goblet of Fire</span> is my favorite of the series thus far.&nbsp; It really the evolution of the series from children's novels to young adult.&nbsp; The movie portrays this very well.&nbsp; Newel deviates from the novel in a few places, but I believe it comes across on the screen as necessary for a film adaptation.&nbsp; The movie skips over Winky, who was a pivital character in the novel.&nbsp; The &quot;mystery&quot; surrounding the house elf was too much ambiguity for the screen, which makes sense.&nbsp; All and all, I think you'll enjoy this one.<br />
</p>
<p>There are a few that left me very curious.&nbsp; The movie doesn't wrap up all the loose ends of the book.&nbsp; I don't want to spoil them, but when you see it (and look back on the novel), you will see there are actually quite a few things left unsaid, undone, etc.&nbsp; I don't know how the next movie can pick up after this one, because it will basicaly have to start with tying up the loose ends of this film.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see how it will be done.<br />
</p>
<p>Finially, there is one last thing I would like to touch on.&nbsp; Pacing.<br />
</p>
<p>The movie versions of these books have been tough because there is a lot of &quot;necessary&quot; content that needs to be explained to the viewer.&nbsp; There are not many things like what Peter Jackson did with <span style="font-style: italic;">Fellowship</span> with Tom Bombidill.&nbsp; Peter had the luxury of not having to translate that part of the story to the screen because it wasn't necessary.&nbsp; There are not many things like that in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Harry Potter</span> series.&nbsp; I do wish they had taken a full 3 hours to tell the story and include a 10 minute intermission.&nbsp; 2.5 hours just didn't seem like enough.</p>
