<p>I touched up the site's CSS.  The background is now fixed, having discovered that finially fixed the bug that causes the CPU to go to 100% when scrolling against a fixed attachment background.&nbsp; I need to update my CD &amp; DVD collections... the DVD collection won't be hard, but I'm in the process of moving my CD collection to a different storage format.&nbsp; Problem is that it requires me to redo it from scratch.&nbsp; The plus is that I get most of the CD covers automatically from Amazon.&nbsp; I think that will take a while.<br />

<p>I have been working on a complete PHP update for the Duke Marching Band site.&nbsp; The original was done in JSP, which while powerful, doesn't lend itself to a third party host, where you don't have control over the server reboots.&nbsp; The PHP port is about 80% complete, and I will probably upload it mid December.<br />
