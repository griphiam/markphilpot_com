I added some more pictures to the gallery (<a href="http://gallery.mcstudios.net">Mia</a>).  When Ann and I were up in Boston a few weeks ago visiting Ann's sister, Mia (our little flower girl for the wedding) was trying on her dress for the wedding.  I was extremely cute!  So I grabbed the camera.  Unfortunately I rushed the images and the room had poor lighting... Anyway I took about 60 pictures and these 10 or so were the best that came out but they needed some serious post processing to correct the color and brightness.  They actually turned out better than I thought they would!  My favorite is definitely 

(Photo removed.  Gallery Reorganized)

Since I got a space boost by my web host, I can now put more pictures up.  =)  And the fun continues.
