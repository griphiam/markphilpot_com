So I took the plunge.  My new <a href="http://gallery.mcstudios.net">gallery</a> is now running G2 Beta 3

I know its a risk, since its beta software, but G2 is <em>SO</em> much better, even in this form, it's worth the jump.  I'll update the links as soon as I can.

Also, please pardon the "dust."  I'm going to do in pace tweaks to the layout, rather than doing it offline.  With WP I can do it in place with hopefully not "much" fuss.  We'll see how it goes.  So if things look <em>really</em> bad, I'm probably in the middle of fixing something.
