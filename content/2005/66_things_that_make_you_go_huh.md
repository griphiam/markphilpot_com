<p>I have now determined I know nothing of the way Hollywood marketing works.&nbsp; Take the following... Do you remember <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208003/">Big Momma's House</a>?&nbsp; Before you <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208003/business">click the link</a>... guess how much it made gross US...&nbsp; (I'll give you a hint... its buget was approx $30 million and it made $25 million on its opening weekend)...<br />
</p>
<p>They are now making a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421729/">sequel</a>!&nbsp; WTF!&nbsp; How the hell does that work?&nbsp; Maybe that's just the economics of having a big star.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I mean, come on!&nbsp; It got <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_mommas_house/">absymal </a>reviews!&nbsp; And yet people went and saw it and it definitely tripped the &quot;Oh we can definitely make profit on this one!&nbsp; Turn out more shit!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p>I guess I should just stop second guessing.&nbsp; Ann and I should make it to a showing of Harry Potter today.&nbsp; Should be good.<br />
