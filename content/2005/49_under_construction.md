As you can see, I've elected to replace my "front page" with my blog.  I like this better, since I've been updating my blog pretty frequently.  Now, the trick will be trying to integrating all the previous content I had back into this "format."  This this is probably a very long term project (and especially with a wedding coming up, I don't see a lot of free time).  But maybe a half hour or two here and there might get some stuff back.

The first step will be to modify the theme.  I basically accepted the theme I liked as is... but since it will now be the front page, I want to bring back some of my old touches (Though as anyone who's tried to manipulate these WP themes can tell you, its not a trivial process).

Anyway, I'll try to get stuff fixed up soon.
