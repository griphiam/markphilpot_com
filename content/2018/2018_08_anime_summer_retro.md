[TOC]

This will be abbreviated because, damn! Am I late to the party on this one...

With the season half way done, I guess it's better late than never.


![Persona 5]({filename}/images/anime/2018/summer/cards/persona5.jpg "Persona 5"){: .ew1920}

### [Persona 5 The Animation](https://anilist.co/anime/99693/Persona-5-The-Animation/)

*Conflicted* -- sums up my thoughts well.

I was expecting better. I wanted better. I now have to wait for an OVA to finish the story (and no word how long we will have to wait nor how long the OVA will be).

Still, I love these characters. I've now played the *P5* game twice and watched two cours of the anime -- so I've invested *a lot* of time into this franchise. If I didn't love the game, I'm fairly sure I would think the anime is just average.

Maybe they will take the time to do the OVA right. Maybe they will give us a two hour proper conclusion. Maybe they will get the original english voice actors to give us an english dub. A lot of *ifs*, but I'm not holding on to hope that any of them will come.

Should you watch it? If you've played the game, I think it's worth it. Otherwise, wait until the OVA drops to make a determination.



![Satsuriku no Tenshi]({filename}/images/anime/2018/summer/cards/angels.jpg "Satsuriku no Tenshi"){: .ew1920}

### [Satsuriku no Tenshi](https://anilist.co/anime/99629)

I feel like there is a piece of context I was missing with *Angels of Death*. There was some interesting morality exploration and some good voice acting, but the dialog was often obtuse and repetitive. Combine that with having to continue with the last four episodes on a different network (I don't believe they are even airing the last four episodes in Japan), this was just a medocre thriller. At this point I've invested enough time that I want to find out what the big reveal is (if there is one).



![Hanebado]({filename}/images/anime/2018/summer/cards/hanebado.jpg "Hanebado"){: .ew1920}

### [Hanebado!](https://anilist.co/anime/101045)

Good lord, the animation! *good*

Good lord, the story! *bad*

The animation on display here is incredible, but the story is only so-so. The relationship between the main character and her mother absolutely strains believability, so much so I'm pulled out of the story. The side characters are good, and the matches are intense and satisfying.

I have no idea how that relationship will go, but I'm sorry. Worst mom ever.


![Harukana Receive]({filename}/images/anime/2018/summer/cards/harukana.jpg "Harukana Receive"){: .ew1920}

### [Harukana Receive](https://anilist.co/anime/99586)

Actual heart to go along with your fan service.

I enjoyed the characters and their relationships, but unfortunately the animation and composition during the matches really left a lot to be desired. If you go into it with low expections, I think you'll find something more than just vanilla fan service.



![Shichisei no Subaru]({filename}/images/anime/2018/summer/cards/subaru.jpg "Shichisei no Subaru"){: .ew1920}

### [Shichisei no Subaru](https://anilist.co/anime/100085)

So very close to dropping this, but I want to find out what the twist is. I'm probably going to just binge/speed watch this.


![Revue Starlight]({filename}/images/anime/2018/summer/cards/revue.jpg "Revue Starlight"){: .ew1920}

### [Shoujoâ˜†Kageki Revue Starlight](https://anilist.co/anime/98658)

The first episode is quite a trip, but I immediately put this on hold as I think it will be better binged that following each week. There is promise in this one, but I have my concerns that the execution will let it down.


![Planet With]({filename}/images/anime/2018/summer/cards/planet_with.jpg "Planet With"){: .ew1920}

### [Planet With](https://anilist.co/anime/101368)

I didn't watch an episode until the season was essentially over and then binged my way through it: This is a fun, rapidly paced mech ride that stumbles a bit with the ending.

It's weird and absurd, but with purpose.

As far as mech shows go, I think it's very digestable for anyone (like myself) that doesn't watch many of them, but will pick one up occasionally ([Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/Tengen-Toppa-Gurren-Lagann/), [Darling in the Franxx](https://anilist.co/anime/99423/Darling-in-the-Franxx/), etc)



![Kyoto Teramachi Sanjou no Holmes]({filename}/images/anime/2018/summer/cards/holmes.jpg "Kyoto Teramachi Sanjou no Holmes"){: .ew1920}

### [Kyoto Teramachi Sanjou no Holmes](https://anilist.co/anime/101292)

Enjoyable, but fails to deliver the one thing we were waiting for:

![Ship It](http://i.imgur.com/zzTu84u.jpg){: .center}

The animation is budget level and the "Sherlock Holmes deductions" don't feel earned (which is going to be a problem for any show that tries to evoke *Sherlock*).
