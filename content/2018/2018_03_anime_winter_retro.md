### [Mahoutsukai no Yome](https://anilist.co/anime/98436)

So let me get this out first: I loved it.

*But...*

It was often painfully obvious that they took the budget of a single cour and tried to spread it out over two. Now, I'm grateful that we got a full 24 episodes rather than a rushed 12, but the source material really demanded a full two cour budget.

Putting aside Neflix again... &lt;grumble/&gt;

Really good.

It's far from Koyani's best work, but that's already a high bar. The art and animation are some of the best work you will see for TV budgets.

Trashy? *Yeah*

Is Mei kinda insufferable? *Nod*

Did I still enjoy it? *Yep*

### [Koi wa Ameagari no You ni](https://anilist.co/anime/98385)

Holy Shit! They stuck the landing!

I almost dropped this a few episodes in. I just had no confidance that I wouldn't be wierded out by the resolution. If not for the fantastic art and music, I might have -- I would have missed out.

Such a fantastic story about relationships, growing up, and reflecting on your past self.

> Anime of the season for me. Calling it right now.

I was wrong.

**Anime of the Year. Calling it right now**

Quite frankly, this could possibly be my favorite anime of all time (Steins;Gate probably still has a lead here, but it's very slim).

I cannot possibly articulate what this show has meant to me. Instead below are two people that can explain it much better than I can:

This is the more of the normal cute girls slice-of-life fair. Camping looks fun presented this way.



![Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens]({filename}/images/anime/2018/winter/cards/ramens.jpg "Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens"){:.ew1920}

### [Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens](https://anilist.co/anime/99483)

This show needs one of those old school detective boards with strings going from picture to picture explaining the relationships. A highly entertaining yet mid-tier show.



![Hakumei to Mikochi]({filename}/images/anime/2018/winter/cards/hakumei.jpg "Hakumei to Mikochi"){:.ew1920}

### [Hakumei to Mikochi](https://anilist.co/anime/99748)

This feels like [Girls' Last Tour](https://anilist.co/anime/99420/ShoujoShuumatsuRyokou) without the apocalypse. A bit of the same vibe with out the existential crisis. A treat each week.



![Märchen Mädchen]({filename}/images/anime/2018/winter/cards/marchen.jpg "Märchen Mädchen"){:.ew1920}

### [Märchen Mädchen](https://anilist.co/anime/99720)

Like _Grancrest_ this will probably be a low rating show that I actually complete. There is enough holding me curious each week to keep me coming back, but there really isn't anything spectacular about this show.

_Curious, but skippable_
