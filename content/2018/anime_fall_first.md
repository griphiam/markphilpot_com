Damn! Through the premier of all the shows on my radar this season and I've only dropped one. 


[TOC]


![Sword Art Online: Alicization]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/100182-oyTLBSN3iT21.jpg "Sword Art Online: Alicization"){: .center}

### [Sword Art Online: Alicization](https://anilist.co/anime/100182)

The anime everyone loves to hate comes out swinging with a double length opening. I can't help it -- I'm onboard for this one.

Sure there were a few bits that were eye-roll worthy, but there was just so much to like! I'm sure this third season will have it's ups and downs, but all I want from an anime is to have fun, and I think *SAO III* will deliver in spades.



![Goblin Slayer]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101165-dVgOyGhEP4mB.jpg "Goblin Slayer"){: .center} 
![White Fox]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/white_fox.png){: .studio}

### [Goblin Slayer](https://anilist.co/anime/101165)

*Holy Fuck! Content Warning! Trigger Warning!*

Do not! I repeat! Do not watch this show if for whatever reason you can't watch graphic violence (including sexual violence). Holy shit, this was gratuitous.

I was *this* close to insta-dropping this, but I think I'm going to give it another episode. This is ultra dark fantasy and that's not something you see very often. I want to see if the opening was done for shock or world building. Frankly, the most likely outcome is that this is dropped a few minutes into episode 2 as this is just not something I'm comfortable with.


![Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101280-aKbf16Sh1b31.jpg "Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">8-bit</div>

### [Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/101280)

I have to give this show credit -- even though it's full on isekai there is enough new ground here, I'm willing to let it see where it goes. Since this is a two cour show, they obviously have the luxury of explaining the mechanics of the world and the abilities of our *main slime*. There is still plenty of ways this can go off the rails quickly, but I definitely like what I've seen so far.




![Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl-senpai no Yume wo Minai]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101291-g1PG2hR0jsxz.jpg "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl-senpai no Yume wo Minai"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">CloverWorks</div>

### [Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl-senpai no Yume wo Minai](https://anilist.co/anime/101291)

For some reason, I got a lot of [Just Because]() vibes from this show. 


![Toaru Majutsu no Index III]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/100185-NHEkbQX2d7JA.jpg "Toaru Majutsu no Index III"){: .center} 
![J.C. Staff]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/jc_staff.png){: .studio}

### [Toaru Majutsu no Index III](https://anilist.co/anime/100185)

It's here! 

And what's even better is there is a third season of [Railgun]() coming *next* year as well!

I have a dilema however. Both *Index* and *Railgun* are up there for my favorite English dubs and it doesn't look like Funimation is simuldubing this one like they did for [Stein's Gate: 0](). Additionally, inexplicablly Crunchyroll seems to have completely fumbled the licensing, so who knows what going to happen.




![Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101316-KTC6TkKogKp8.jpg "Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara"){: .center} 
![P.A. Works]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/pa_works.png){: .studio}

### [Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara](https://anilist.co/anime/101316)

Damn! I am on board for this one!

Leave it to PA Works to get me seriously hyped for a slice of life show combining magic and time travel. The visuals are vintage PA Works (aka bloody fantastic).



![Zombie Land Saga]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/103871-EvtLKTd9OV1q.jpg "Zombie Land Saga"){: .center} 
![MAPPA]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/mappa.png){: .studio}

### [Zombie Land Saga](https://anilist.co/anime/103871)

*Damn!*

That's one way to do an idol show. 



![Yagate Kimi ni Naru]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101573-u75RNeMBd2vz.jpg "Yagate Kimi ni Naru"){: .center} 
![TROYCA]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/troyca.png){: .studio}

### [Yagate Kimi ni Naru](https://anilist.co/anime/101573)

Being a fan of the source manga, I was very excited for this show. The character designs don't *quite* match what I expected coming from the manga, the animation is very good and the voice actresses of our two leads are pitch perfect. The only trick will be where and how they decide to end the show. There isn't an obvious point that I can recall and I will be interested to see what kind of story they end up telling.



![SSSS.GRIDMAN]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/99424-9bV9lbUhynar.jpg "SSSS.GRIDMAN"){: .center} 
![Trigger]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/trigger.png){: .studio}

### [SSSS.GRIDMAN](https://anilist.co/anime/99424)

Welp, I guess I'm watching another mech show this season.

Honestly, I think I would prefer character interactions over the mech battles -- I have a soft spot for Trigger's character aestetics.



![Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101310-w1PLPsyg0XHr.jpg "Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet"){: .center} 
![LIDENFILMS]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/lidenfilms.png){: .studio}

### [Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet](https://anilist.co/anime/101310)

I'm not sure how far I'll go with this one. A lot will depend on how the central relationship develops. If it becomes clear that their relationship is just a foil for contrived hijinx, I think I'll end up skipping it.



![Radiant]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101024-4dFUVMKSE0Q1.jpg "Radiant"){: .center} 
![Lerche, NHK]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/lerche.png){: .studio}

### [Radiant](https://anilist.co/anime/101024)

Despite the really interesting backstory to this production, *Radiant* is first on my dropped list this season. Shonen series aren't really my cup of tea to begin with and there really wasn't anything to hook me like there was with [My Hero Academia](). However, if you are a shonen fan, I would recommend checking this one out.



![Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101371-K4cKNCyTRw04.png "Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">Studio Gokumi, AXsiZ</div>

### [Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san](https://anilist.co/anime/101371)

This is so obviously a 4-koma comic adaptation. All the beats and pacing are really letting the source bleed through. I'm not familar with the source material so I can't comment on how well the adaptation is, but I'll keep up with this one for another couple of episodes as they introduce more of the cast.



![Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101506-uY2udopqvdYp.jpg "Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru"){: .center} 
![Doga Kobo]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/dogakobo.png){: .studio}

### [Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru](https://anilist.co/anime/101506)

This is taking lolicon to the point of pedephilia. There is some really great animation at work here, but if the relationship dynamic doesn't settle somewhere in the ballpark of normal, I'm just going to lump this into wierd, unhealthy Japanese fetishes and move on.



![RELEASE THE SPYCE]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101014-D61mk3qviix3.jpg "RELEASE THE SPYCE"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">Lay-duce</div>

### [RELEASE THE SPYCE](https://anilist.co/anime/101014)

[Princess Principal]() did it better.

That's not to say *Spyce* isn't good -- I think I was just hoping for a show like this to have a bit more edge. Maybe that is coming now that everyone is introduced.



![Ulysses: Jeanne d'Arc to Renkin no Kishi]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/100432-uh8RbRmENiER.jpg "Ulysses: Jeanne d'Arc to Renkin no Kishi"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">AXsiZ</div>

### [Ulysses: Jeanne d'Arc to Renkin no Kishi](https://anilist.co/anime/100432)

Well that's one way to do a time skip.

I need a few more episodes to get a clear indication on what type of story they are going to tell.

### [Anima Yell!](https://anilist.co/anime/101013)

A shoestring animation budget is doing this show no service. I'm going to reserve final judgement until the rest of the cast is introduced (and to see if the animation improves), but there was real *uncanny valley* going on.
