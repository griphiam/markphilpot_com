Damn! Through the premier of all the shows on my radar this season and I've only dropped one. 


[TOC]

### [Sword Art Online: Alicization](https://anilist.co/anime/100182)

The anime everyone loves to hate comes out swinging with a double length opening. I can't help it -- I'm onboard for this one.

Sure there were a few bits that were eye-roll worthy, but there was just so much to like! I'm sure this third season will have it's ups and downs, but all I want from an anime is to have fun, and I think *SAO III* will deliver in spades.



![Goblin Slayer]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101165-dVgOyGhEP4mB.jpg "Goblin Slayer"){: .center} 
![White Fox]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/white_fox.png){: .studio}

### [Goblin Slayer](https://anilist.co/anime/101165)

*Holy Fuck! Content Warning! Trigger Warning!*

Do not! I repeat! Do not watch this show if for whatever reason you can't watch graphic violence (including sexual violence). Holy shit, this was gratuitous.

I was *this* close to insta-dropping this, but I think I'm going to give it another episode. This is ultra dark fantasy and that's not something you see very often. I want to see if the opening was done for shock or world building. Frankly, the most likely outcome is that this is dropped a few minutes into episode 2 as this is just not something I'm comfortable with.


![Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101280-aKbf16Sh1b31.jpg "Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">8-bit</div>

### [Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/101280)

I have to give this show credit -- even though it's full on isekai there is enough new ground here, I'm willing to let it see where it goes.

<div class="studio">CloverWorks</div>

### [Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl-senpai no Yume wo Minai](https://anilist.co/anime/101291)

For some reason, I got a lot of [Just Because]() vibes from this show.


![Toaru Majutsu no Index III]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/100185-NHEkbQX2d7JA.jpg "Toaru Majutsu no Index III"){: .center} 
![J.C. Staff]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/jc_staff.png){: .studio}

### [Toaru Majutsu no Index III](https://anilist.co/anime/100185)

It's here! 

And what's even better is there is a third season of [Railgun]() coming *next* year as well!

I have a dilema however. Both *Index* and *Railgun* are up there for my favorite English dubs and it doesn't look like Funimation is simuldubing this one like they did for [Stein's Gate: 0](). I'm going to give it a few episodes to see if there is an announcement of an English dub in the future, otherwise I'll reorient myself to the original Japanese VAs.

> In Nagasaki, a descendant of mages, 17-year-old Hitomi lost her sense of color at a young age and grew up lacking emotion. Her grandmother Kohaku, a great mage, sends Hitomi to the past, to the year 2018. There, she spends time with a 17-year-old Kohaku and friends from club activities.<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: ANN)

### [Zombie Land Saga](https://anilist.co/anime/103871)

*Damn!*

That's one way to do an idol show.

### [SSSS.GRIDMAN](https://anilist.co/anime/99424)

> Collaboration with Tsuburaya Productions.<br><br><br/><br/>Yuta Hibiki awakens with amnesia and the ability see things that others cannot. He first encounters a Gridman in the reflection of his friend Rikka Takarada's computer and it tells him to "Remember his calling," but Yuta doesn't understand what this means. Later, in the distance, he sees an extremely large monster but it doesn't move. It's only when Yuta gets to school that the two sightings make sense: a monster attacks and the hero Yuta saw in the computer screen pulls him within the computer and transforms Yuta into a giant hero named Gridman.<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: ANN)

![Lerche, NHK]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/lerche.png){: .studio}

### [Radiant](https://anilist.co/anime/101024)

Despite the really interesting backstory to this production, *Radiant* is first on my dropped list this season. Shonen series aren't really my cup of tea to begin with and there really wasn't anything to hook me like there was with [My Hero Academia](). However, if you are a shonen fan, I would recommend checking this one out.



![Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101371-K4cKNCyTRw04.png "Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">Studio Gokumi, AXsiZ</div>

### [Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san](https://anilist.co/anime/101371)

This is so obviously a 4-koma comic adaptation. All the beats and pacing are really letting the source bleed through. I'm not familar with the source material so I can't comment on how well the adaptation is, but I'll keep up with this one for another couple of episodes as they introduce more of the cast.



![Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101506-uY2udopqvdYp.jpg "Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru"){: .center} 
![Doga Kobo]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/dogakobo.png){: .studio}

### [Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru](https://anilist.co/anime/101506)

This is taking lolicon to the point of pedephilia. There is some really great animation at work here, but if the relationship dynamic doesn't settle somewhere in the ballpark of normal, I'm just going to lump this into wierd, unhealthy Japanese fetishes and move on.



![RELEASE THE SPYCE]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/101014-D61mk3qviix3.jpg "RELEASE THE SPYCE"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">Lay-duce</div>

### [RELEASE THE SPYCE](https://anilist.co/anime/101014)

[Princess Principal]() did it better.

That's not to say *Spyce* isn't good -- I think I was just hoping for a show like this to have a bit more edge. Maybe that is coming now that everyone is introduced.



![Ulysses: Jeanne d'Arc to Renkin no Kishi]({filename}/images/anime/2018/fall/100432-uh8RbRmENiER.jpg "Ulysses: Jeanne d'Arc to Renkin no Kishi"){: .center} 
<div class="studio">AXsiZ</div>

### [Ulysses: Jeanne d'Arc to Renkin no Kishi](https://anilist.co/anime/100432)

Well that's one way to do a timeskip.

![Production I.G]({filename}/images/anime/studios/half/production_ig.png){: .studio}

### [Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru](https://anilist.co/anime/101903)

I'm going to give this show one more episode, but my bet is that it's the next series on the dropped list.

Although Derrida and Nathan are aware of the danger, they reluctantly decide to put off taking any measures, and instead go to Nathan's daughter Mage's birthday party. The next day, after enjoying a peaceful day, Derrida and Nathan are suddenly attacked by unknown forces. At the end of the escape, Derrida falls into a cold sleep machine and 10 years later, he wakes up to a devastated world in the middle of a war.

### [Anima Yell!](https://anilist.co/anime/101013)

A shoestring animation budget is doing this show no service. I'm going to reserve final judgement until the rest of the cast is introduced (and to see if the animation improves), but there was real *uncanny valley* going on.
