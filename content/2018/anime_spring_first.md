This year has been a feast of riches for the anime community. So many good shows -- originals and sequels to favorites.

### [Steins;Gate 0](https://anilist.co/anime/21127)

How do you follow arguably the best anime of all time? I have absolutely no idea.

I don't know *anything* about *S;G 0*, but after watching the first episode I fear this will be two cours worth of gut punches.

In addition to being my favorite anime of all time, the original is also my favorite dub of all time. For me, these characters *are* made by the english cast. I haven't seen any official announcement for the english cast but I *pray* the original members are back for the sequel.

### [Boku no Hero Academia 3](https://anilist.co/anime/100166)

> The third season of <i>Boku no Hero Academia</i>.

### [Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online](https://anilist.co/anime/100183)

So before jumping to conclusions, you have to remember that this go around is done by *Studio 3hz* which made [Princess Principal](https://anilist.co/anime/98505/Princess-Principal/) -- one of my favorite shows from last year.

So far this one is extremely promising. The characters are good and it seems like they might avoid the pitfalls that bogged down the original SAO.

### [Persona 5 The Animation](https://anilist.co/anime/99693)

> You'll never see it coming!

My god, watching this makes me want to play the game again. But with the show, I get to relive the game without re-investing the 100+ hours.

Objectively, anyone watching this who hasn't played the game may struggle with the pacing -- they rush through a lot in the first few episodes, so anyone without game expierence might feel adrift.

But I'm going to enjoy every second of this one. Oh and just an aside, I really hope they ship Makoto, which is obviously the only *real* choice =)

What a trip!

### [Golden Kamui](https://anilist.co/anime/99699)

> In the early twentieth century, Russo-Japanese War veteran Saichi “Immortal” Sugimoto scratches out a meager existence during the postwar gold rush in the wilderness of Hokkaido. When he stumbles across a map to a fortune in hidden Ainu gold, he sets off on a treacherous quest to find it. But Sugimoto is not the only interested party, and everyone who knows about the gold will kill to possess it! Faced with the harsh conditions of the northern wilderness, ruthless criminals and rogue Japanese soldiers, Sugimoto will need all his skills and luck—and the help of an Ainu girl named Asirpa—to survive.<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: Viz Media)

What the fuck is this? Good lord.

### [Mahou Shoujo Site](https://anilist.co/anime/100010)

GAG!

Holy shit this is disgusting. Between this and *Devils Line*, I don't know who runs away with the worst anime of the season.



![Caligula]({filename}/images/anime/2018/spring/100569-LBfpdDhS4oBE.jpg "Caligula"){: .center} 

<div class="studio">Satelight</div>

### [Caligula](https://anilist.co/anime/100569)

This show is better than it has any right to be. With a setup reminicient of [Angel Beats](https://anilist.co/anime/6547/Angel-Beats/) it still could fall flat.



![3D Kanojo]({filename}/images/anime/2018/spring/100526-LqDnjcIhDakp.jpg "3D Kanojo"){: .center} 

<div class="studio">Hoods Entertainment</div>

### [3D Kanojo](https://anilist.co/anime/100526)

My first reactions to the opening episode were all variations of cringing. To the show's credit however, it pulled out and showed some backbone by actually moving the relationship dymanic forward. The whole setup feels extremely self induligent and contrived. I put it on hold, but I'm going to check back in towards the end of the season to see if managed to carve a niche for itself.



![Comic Girls]({filename}/images/anime/2018/spring/99131-DN6yv26YqjBa.jpg "Comic Girls"){: .center} 

<div class="studio">Nexus</div>

### [Comic Girls](https://anilist.co/anime/99131)

Vibes of [New Game](https://anilist.co/anime/21455/New-Game/) but not nearly as good. Characters are more trope architypes than blends, but that doesn't mean there isn't an opportunity to have some character development. However, if I had to guess I don't think we'll see the sort of character exporation we saw in *New Game*.

### [Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi](https://anilist.co/anime/100500)

This one went immediately on hold. Not that it looks bad -- I just can't take on another two cour show that I'm only going to be so-son on.

### [Asagao to Kase-san](https://anilist.co/anime/99916)

> Yamada may be shy and rather clumsy, but the flower gardens at her school have always brought her happiness. Suddenly, a different sort of beauty catches her eye—the vivacious track star, Kase-san. Although the two girls don't seem to have much in common, they soon start a romance where each must learn an important lesson in tending their budding relationship. Can the two girls, so different from each other, learn how to make their first love blossom?<br><br><br/><br/>(Source: Seven Seas)
