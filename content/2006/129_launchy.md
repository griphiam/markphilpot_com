So I stumbled upon <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> today.&nbsp; The documentation is fairly poor, but it's a laucher for OSX.&nbsp; The fundamental idea is that you press a hotkey combination and start typing the name of the program as soon as it finds a match, you press enter and it runs.&nbsp; I was skeptical, but people rave about it.&nbsp; So I thought... OK is there a windows equivalent?<br /><br />Well there is a great open source equivalent -- <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a>.&nbsp; Small download, small resource usage and it fits the bill perfectly.&nbsp; Download and try it.&nbsp; I don't think you will be disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is much better than trying to navigate the Start Menu with a mouse (especially on a laptop).&nbsp; You'll soon find it is indispensible (and I've just been using it for a few hours!)
