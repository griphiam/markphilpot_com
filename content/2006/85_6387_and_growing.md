I have now reached over 6,000 pictures in my image database (managed with iMatch, of which I've categorized about 90% of it.  iMatch's category system is so incredibly powerful), which I think take over 12 GB of space (which it all resides on my laptop hard drive... not the most secure solution).  This doesn't include all the Photoshop work (which is a few GBs of its own!)

I've been thinking about how to deal with this.  What I'd like to do is a NAS (network attached storage) RAID (redundant array of inexpensive discs) system.  <a title="Tom's Networking" href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com">Tom's Networking</a> has reviews of a bunch <a title="NAS products" href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/NAS.php">NAS solutions</a>, (a few of which can go up to 1.2 TB).  The one with the highest recommendation is <a title="Infrant NAS" href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-217-ProdID-H2H5.php">this one</a> (albiet fairly pricey, but comes close to reaching that $1 per GB ratio).  It also supports <a title="RAID 5..." href="http://www.raid.com/04_01_05.html">RAID 5</a> (quite cool).

Ideally (if money weren't an option), I'd put together a gig-e network and attach a NAS RAID product.  Oh well.  I'll figure out something.
