<p>As disappointed as I am with what <a title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration" href="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a> has done (or more accurately, hasn't done) since the 80's, there is still something awe inspiring about moving men and women into space, that I don't believe will ever get old.&nbsp; I am someone that can still watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/" name="Huston, we have a problem...">Apollo 13</a> over and over because of the triumph that it represents.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the beaucracy at NASA and the lack of foresight and funding from Congress has religated the one great United States Space Program to an after thought...&nbsp; A political liability... And probably many other things that don't get revealed to the general public.&nbsp; Since the termination of the <a title="Last small step for man" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Program">Apollo</a> program, the United States Space program has not gone beyone an <a title="Low Earth Orbit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_Orbit">LEO</a> (basically).</p>
<p>As a kid, I can remember watching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger" title="Space Shuttle Challenger">Challenger</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster" title="STS-51-L -- January 28, 1986">disaster</a> live on TV (on one of the few stations actually broadcasting the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsv0PS5yYs4&amp;search=Challenger%20space%20shuttle" title="Challenger Launch Video">launch</a> live).&nbsp; The Columbia disaster unfolded at a <a title="DUMB" href="http://www.duke.edu/web/DUMB/">band</a> meeting at Duke.&nbsp; We were in the Poly Sci building and were trying to find a classroom with TV and some sort of cable or broadcast feed.&nbsp; I believe the tradegys could have been avoided.&nbsp; There were/are too many levels to the NASA beaucracy (too many managers in the closet).&nbsp; Challenger was literally the text book example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_think" title="Amplified by political pressure">Group Think</a>.&nbsp; Columbia was believing that past successes translated into future successes and management stiffling engineering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time I believe the media trivializes the risks involved in space flight.&nbsp; Until something like the <a title="Hopefully sooner rather than later..." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Elevator">Space Elevator</a> comes along or alternative technology that doesn't involve strapping thousands of tons of liquid explosives to yourself, there is no way you can reduce the risk.&nbsp; Its an amazing feat they acomplish now with as few tradegies as we've had.&nbsp; While we stick with current technologies, space flight will never be equal to air travel.&nbsp; Its a little dissapointing that we haven't make it further in the 40 years since the Apollo program.</p>
<p>Thankfully the Discovery launch went off without a hitch and that is exactly what the program needed.&nbsp; They are finishing a detailed inspection of the shuttle's heat tiles, and while I haven't heard the results, I hope they don't find anything.&nbsp; The kicker will be if they can land without any issue.&nbsp; Godspeed.</p>
