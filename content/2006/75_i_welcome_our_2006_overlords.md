Need to get to sleep, now... Will have to wake up at 4:00am to get on a 6:00am flight out of Oakland tomorrow.  Yuck.

"The Redesign" is coming. I have to translate all my old pages into Wordpress "pages."  It just seems like a better CMS system than a roll-your-own each time.  January looks to be quite busy, so it may take a while to get it out the door.

Also, I will have a book review up in the next week or so.  I finished a great one over the holidays.

(On a random note the resident cat in my Mom's house... Its Daniels... is now chasing a knat and just did a not-too-shabby back flip in an attempt to get it...  ask anyone of us.  It's a wierd cat).
