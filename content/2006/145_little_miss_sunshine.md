<p>This is such a fantastic movie, and really shows (I think) where the industry is going with film -- smaller, independent productions with quality actors.&nbsp; The recent success of films by Liongate Films and Fox Searchlight seems to be catching on.</p>
<p>With the success of 40-Year-Old Virgin, Steve Carell's stock has been soaring.&nbsp; In Sunshine though, he streches his acting even further, and I was tremendously impressed.&nbsp; His character is complex, emotionally scarred, but still has the little bit of wit and humor we know Carell posesses.</p>
<p>There is a great evolution in the film as it progresses from the opening scene in hospital ward.&nbsp; While it starts with drama-like seriousness, as each of the members of the family are revealed and pile into the van for a trip to Los Angeles we loose the seriousness in favor of humorous family quirks but without loosing the sincerity.&nbsp; What you end up with is really a loveable dysfunctional family.</p>
<p>Its pretty slow right now for good movies.&nbsp; I haven't heard anything good coming up this fall/winter.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see who the Oscar contenders are this year -- my guess is that might be another 'sleeper' hit like Crash.<br /></p>
