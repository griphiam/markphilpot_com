<h3>&lsquo;But the hour cometh, and now is&rsquo; - John 4:23</h3>
<p>March Madness is like Christmas come early.&nbsp; I get goose bumps with the build up of the conference tournaments.&nbsp; March is a special month.&nbsp; The 65-team single elimination format is one of the most exciting things in sports.&nbsp; However, I side with the rest of the world when it comes to the World Cup... one of the most fantastic and celebrated events in sports.&nbsp; This event is only once every four years, which makes it so much more meaningful and special.&nbsp; It really is what the Olympics wished it were.</p>
<p>The wait is over!<br /></p>
<p>I know most of the United States disagrees with me.&nbsp; Indeed, most of the sports comentary has been relegated to how much the rest of the world revels in the Cup compared to relatively paltry following locally.&nbsp; I grew up playing soccer, so it really is my sport of choice.&nbsp; I didn't really &quot;discover&quot; basketball until I arrived at Duke.&nbsp; However, I also understand why soccer is tough to follow and enjoy if you haven't grown up with it.&nbsp; 0-0 ties and 1-0 wins are a long 90 minutes.&nbsp; But think of it this way... A good pitcher's duel in baseball might be 1-0 and we find that exciting (its also more like 3 hours...)&nbsp; Or even worse really, American football.&nbsp; Lets focus on the fact that its really an inflated score to cultivate more excitement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Really a 21-14 football game is fundamentally 3-2.&nbsp; Americans like <em>points</em>.</p>
<p>In other installments I'll continue to pontificate on this =)&nbsp; -- And since Sim demanded more prompt posting, I'll try to make the updates more frequent for Round 2 - Part 2 =)</p>
<h4> Round 1 - Part 1 (Highlights)</h4>
<p><strong>Germany 4 - Costa Rica 2</strong></p>
<p>What a way to open up the quest for the Cup.&nbsp; The home team looked very good in front of their home crowd.&nbsp; Their offense showed their potential, with their defense leaving a few questions.&nbsp; Electing to play a flat back 4, Costa Rica's two goals came when they managed to get behind the German defense.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see if they make some adjustments going forward.&nbsp; With the definite home field advantage throughout, Germany will be tough to beat.&nbsp; Despite the loss, Costa Rica looks like it has a good chance of moving out of the first round.</p>
<p><strong>Poland 0 - Ecuador 2</strong></p>
<p>First of all, there is nothing quite like an Irishman and an Enlishman calling a soccer match.&nbsp; I forget the names of the two announcers, but when they opened up the broadcast it brought a smile to my face.&nbsp; That is the way you need to listen to soccer.&nbsp; Not to put down our American comentators, but they can't hold a candle to that.</p>
<p><strong>England 1 - Paraguay 0</strong></p>
<p>I'll guarantee you the English fans are not quite happy with this performance (though they'll definitely be happy to take three points with them).&nbsp; They have serious talent, but definitely looked out of sync.&nbsp; This could have easily ended in a 0-0 tie.&nbsp; Too many stupid fouls and not enough control in the mid-field</p>
<p><strong>Argentina 2 - Ivory Coast 1</strong></p>
<p>Argentina looked <em>good!</em>&nbsp; Like the Argentina of old!&nbsp; Unfortunately they would only meet the Brazilians in the finals I think... Oh that would be a fantastic game!</p>
<p><strong>Serbia &amp; Montenegro 0 - Netherlands 1</strong></p>
<p>If you missed this game you really missed text book soccer.&nbsp; The Netherland team is so disiplined!&nbsp; Incredibly crisp passes.&nbsp; They dominated the time of posession easily.&nbsp; They aren't flashy, but they know how to control the game and are really fun to watch (from a soccer lover's perspective).</p>
<p><strong>United States 0 - Czech Republic 3</strong></p>
<p>Ouch!&nbsp; Damn!&nbsp; Fuck!&nbsp; That really, really hurt.&nbsp; There could be posts written on this one, but I think the media has bludgeoned it to death.&nbsp; We'll see how Saturday goes before passing final judgement.</p>
<p><strong>Australia 3 - Japan 1</strong></p>
<p>Aussi Aussi Aussi!!!&nbsp; What a blast Down Under must be having.&nbsp; Three goals in the last 10 minutes!&nbsp; And the first three goals for Australia ever in a World Cup!&nbsp; You have to love it!</p>
<p><strong>Brazil 1 - Croatia 0</strong></p>
<p>The perenial favorites.&nbsp; While not a great game per se, you definitely saw flashes of Brazilian Brilliance.&nbsp; They are definitely beatable.&nbsp; They might loose one in this first round, but I'd be hard pressed to take someone else.&nbsp; Argentina perhaps... Germany maybe... but the safe money is on still on Brazil at the moment.</p>
