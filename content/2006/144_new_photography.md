I know its been a while since I posted any new pictures.  I have quite a bit backlogged that I need to sort through and post.  So think of this as the first wave =)

The shots of the GGB were taken at Fort Baker where Ann and I put in on a kayack trip under the bridge and out into the Pacific (celebrating our first anniversary).  That really was fun... through we single handedly capsized our guide's kayack, dumping him into the choppy Pacific.  Thankfully he was able to get back in OK.  I hope to post pictures from Jake &amp; Ann's wedding this weekend, so stay tuned.
