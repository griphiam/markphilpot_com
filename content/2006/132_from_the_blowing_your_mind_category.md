<p>Check <a href="http://www.rense.com/general67/street.htm">this</a> out!&nbsp; This guy is simply a freak of nature.&nbsp; That is some serious force perspective stuff!</p>
<p>Along the same lines the French artist <a title="Permanent Link to Notes on the Denial of Perspective 02 - Felice Varini" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.gravestmor.com/wp/archives/2006/01/10/notes-on-the-denial-of-perspective-02-felice-varini/">Felice Varini</a> (more <a href="http://www.varini.org/02indc/indgen.html">here</a>) does some incredible things as well.&nbsp; I think a lot of his stuff could be acomplished with a laser leveler, but it is still quite remarkable.&nbsp; It reminds me of an exhibit Ann and I saw at the Modern Art Musem here in DC where the guy constructed incredible things with colored fluorescent tubes and he would take advantage of corners and angles of the room.&nbsp; The different solid colors would blend together to create new colors and shapes.&nbsp; Normally, I'm not a modern art fan, but that was one of my favorites as far as it goes.</p>
