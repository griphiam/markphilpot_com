I didn't mean to have two anti-Microsoft posts in one day, but <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winvista_5308_05.asp" title="Paul Thurrott">this article</a> was too well written to pass up.  It basically outlines the failings of Microsoft when it comes to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windowsvista/">Vista</a>.  I used to be enthusiastic about Microsoft prodcuts -- granted that was a long time ago.  With the improvements of Windows emulation in Linux (<a href="http://www.winehq.com/" title="Wine Is Not an Emulator">Wine</a> and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/" title="Emulation">Xen</a>), I have already decided that I will not be upgrading to Vista.  My laptop runs XP right now because IBM provided lots of cool customizations for their laptop that just won't work on Linux.  However when I build my next desktop, I'm definitely taking <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> (<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> version of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>).
