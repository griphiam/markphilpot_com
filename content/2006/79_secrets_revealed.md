Well, not really.  Behold my new theme (obviously incomplete).  I still need to transfer lots of content over, but it got to a point where I wanted to work with it on the real site, rather than localhost.

I discovered that I have lost my MC Studios logo (which is why there isn't one on the banner now).  I thought I had the Photoshop file on my graphics backup disc, but apparently not.  I have the fonts necessary to recreate it, so that is one of my many upcoming tasks to acomplish.

Try out the search bar to the right.  Very cool stuff.  Let me know what you think.  I was going to something more simple and less busy (and easier to read I might add).
