<p>The fire alarm went off last night, and instead of being a quick leave-the-building-shut-off-the-alarm-go-back routine, an impressive array of firetrucks (complete with a ladder being raised to the roof of our building) greeted us outside.</p>
<p>Thankfully it didn't turn into anything serious.&nbsp; Aparently there was a gas leak on the eighth floor (Ann &amp; I are on the sixth), so they brought in fans to try to clear everything out.&nbsp; However something jumped out at me as we were waiting for everything to clear -- in case of a real fire, we'd be pretty screwed.&nbsp; I saw a few other people who had grabbed a handfull of things on their way out (pictures &amp; papers mostly).&nbsp; For the huge building, it was an incredibly small minority who had bothered to take anything more than their keys and wallet.&nbsp; But all my pictures, papers, and anything else of necessary value (which are mostly digital anyway) are located exclusively in our apartment and no where else.&nbsp; Yeah, I've been good about moving things to CD/DVD every few months, but its not like a fire would only take out the originals and leave the backups.</p>
<p>As a result, my immediate task for the next few days is to gather up everything that I would want saved (digitally at least), burn it to CD and mail it home to California for safe keeping.&nbsp; An offsite filesystem (~1TB or so) would be ideal so you could make periodic backups -- but absent that, this will have to do.<br /></p>
<p>I've already had the expirence of losing pictures and documents from a hard drive that went belly up when I had not made any backups.&nbsp; I can't imagine the multiplier effect of having everything taken out by fire -- on top of everything else you have to worry about.<br /></p>
