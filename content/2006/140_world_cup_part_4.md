<h3>Quarter Finals</h3>
<p><strong>Germany 1 - Argentina 1 (Germany wins on PK)</strong></p>
<p>Fantastic!&nbsp; Just what was billed.&nbsp; Germany has shown they have the fortitude to continue on, especially continuing to attack and find the equalizer late in the second half.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the end scuffle was all about... I didn't read anything about it here, but I'm sure the German papers covered it.&nbsp; Since I've been watching all the matches via DVR, I skip all the pre-game and halftime analysis, so I don't know if it was covered then.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Italy 3 - Ukraine 0</strong></p>
<p>What a trouncing!&nbsp; Italy was never challenged in this one.<br /></p>
<p><strong>England 0 - Portugal 0 (Portugal wins on PK)</strong></p>
<p>England's innept offense finially catches up with them.&nbsp; It only got worse with Beckham leaving early with an injury and Wayne Rooney given a red card.&nbsp; Rooney sure has a temper.&nbsp; I know he's coming off an injury and this is the first time I've seen him, but other than intensity and a temper, I didn't see much else to be excited about (at least not nearly the way the England side does).&nbsp; I hope ESPN will start showing more Premier League soccer, so we can follow up on some of this stuff.&nbsp; Both sides had chances to win this prior to PKs.&nbsp; But when it came down to it, England's PK looked tired and Portugal's keeper came up big.&nbsp; Almost all of Portugal's PK's were untouchable.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Brazil 0 - France 1</strong></p>
<p>The one team that could give Brazil fits, did so.&nbsp; France locked down incredibly hard on defense... to the tune of 0 shots for Brazil (they may have got one off at the end, but literally only feeble attemps).&nbsp; It looked nothing like previous Brazil teams and that should be entirely to France's credit.&nbsp; I only remember bits of Zidane's performances in the 1998 WC, but he is still a fun player to watch, and in my opinion has played much better in this Cup than Rhonaldino of Brazil.&nbsp; Henry is incredibly fast, and while his attacking style yields him the leader in offsides, all it takes is one chance.</p>
<h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
<p>My previous installment misrepresented the semifinal match ups.&nbsp; Germany squares off against Italy tomorrow with Portugal taking on France on Wednesday with the consolation and finals taking place on Saturday and Sunday respectfully.&nbsp; Portugal won't be as depeleted as they could have been, however I still see France moving on to the finals.&nbsp; France combines the offense with the defense that you need.&nbsp; Portugal has been playing some inspired soccer, but they just don't have enough to pull off the upset.</p>
<p>Germany versus Italy should be another great game.&nbsp; Germany's defense is still a bit shaky, but they held their own so far, so maybe its about time to stop doubting it.&nbsp; On a neutral field, I would call this a draw, but with the tremendous home field advantage, Germany should have enough to pull out another victory.<br /></p>
