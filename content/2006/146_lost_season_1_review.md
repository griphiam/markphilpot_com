<p>Yes, yes, I know this is just a tad late, but I finially got around to watching the series.&nbsp; First of all, let me get a few points out of the way.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Comercial-less box set TV shows is really the only way to watch quality programs like this.&nbsp; I did the same with Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, and now Lost.&nbsp; You quickly realize that each episode is infanitely better with out the interuptions of commercials every 10 minutes or so.&nbsp; I probably won't watch BG or Lost on TV for either of their Season 3 -- instead waiting for the DVDs.&nbsp; It's the only way to go.</li>
    <li>The industry just doesn't understand P2P.&nbsp; I downloaded Lost first because I wanted to be sure I liked it.&nbsp; As a result, they sold a Season 1 box set and definitely Season 2 when it arrives.&nbsp; I'm still not big on rentals (either Blockbuster or Netflix), and in my mind they are not an equal opportunity.<br /></li>
    <li>I'm starting this review halfway through the season (about episode 10, I think).&nbsp; If you haven't seen Lost at all, don't read this review, as it will most definitely have spoilers in it.&nbsp; As I start reviews and asking questions, I'll try to go back and put in updates as I watch more episodes.</li>
    <li>Any paragraph preceeded by -- is one written after I completed watching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have our basis taken care of... lets continue.</p>
<p>When Lost was first announced, it didn't make an impression on me one way or another, and as a result, I did not tune in for the first episode.&nbsp; On a show like this, it really is detriment to the viewer to come in having missed anything.&nbsp; I think I saw episode 4 at some point when I was flipping through channels, but since I had missed the crutial first three episodes, I wasn't invested in any of the characters, so I tuned out for the rest of the season.&nbsp; It recieved critical aclaim as a must-see series, basically running against Fox's 24.&nbsp; Obviously, we're about to start season 3 this fall, so its definitely done well for itself to say the least.&nbsp; Again, I'm glad I got to see it without the commercials.&nbsp; I'm spoiled by HBO and shows like Deadwood without interruptions.&nbsp; Obviously, Lost is still cut and paced to have commercials unlike Deadwood, but its still infinitely better than suffering through bad car and beer comercials.</p>
<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>
<p>On a show that revolves around being stranded on a 'deserted' island, the characters become your most important asset -- and Lost does not disappoint.&nbsp; Each character is fundamentally flawed, scared, heroic, self-serving enough to be believeable and demand sympathy (we'll come back to the believeablility is a moment).&nbsp; The actors they chose are fantastic, with few besides Dominic Mogan (LOTR) having very many other jobs on the big or small screen.&nbsp; With such an ensemble cast, I like how (at least in the initial episodes) dedicate each episode to the back story of one or two of the characters.&nbsp; I know they are all necessary, but I found myself wanting to more quickly get back to scenes on the island.</p>
<p>-- I like how they have left themselves lots of backstory in each character to slowly reveal over the next few seasons.&nbsp; It seems like they use the flashbacks to increase the tension in the present, and yes, frankly do a good job of it.<br /></p>
<p>Really the Island itself is a character unto its own -- and at the moment I'm suspending judgement.&nbsp; I think they offered too much too quickly.&nbsp; It seems too contrived as an elaborate rat maze/race, rather than a wild unknown force, which I think would be more realistic.&nbsp; This may change in later episodes... we'll see.</p>
<p>-- Nope... see my section below on believeability.<br /></p>
<p><em>Jack</em></p>
<p>If you want to say the show has a main character, you'd probably point to Jack.&nbsp; The charasmatic leader, the essential doctor that you need on a show like this.<br /></p>
<p><em>Kate</em></p>
<p>So far one of the more interesting characters.&nbsp; Thankfully they have only slowly let out her backstory, so there is still a good bit of mystery.</p>
<p>-- Unlike some of the other characters, I don't think she developed as much over the first season.&nbsp; Very focused and driven with goals of her own.&nbsp; She's the linchpin between many pairs of characters.<br /></p>
<p><em>Sawyer</em></p>
<p>On a show like this, you need this character.&nbsp; He's a bit like Doctor Gaius Baltar on Battlestar Galactica (on a side note, I just realized -- there are substantial parallels between Lost and BG.&nbsp; Make the following substitutions: Island = Cylons.&nbsp; Sawyer = Gaius, Jack = Apollo, Kate = Starbuck, Locke = Captian Odama... I guess there is no Co. Ty equivalent.&nbsp; Wow... for anyone who has seen both... does this work?&nbsp; Anyway, we'll leave that to another post).&nbsp; I really hope the character evolves, as different facets of the Island replace the conflict he represents -- eventually it should happen as they start to run out of supplies.</p>
<p>-- At the end of the season, this parellel doesn't work as well, and arguably could replace Sawyer with Locke.&nbsp; Sawyer still retained his flaws, but overall his character has softened... the most development over the season 1 arc.<br /></p>
<p><em>Saiad</em></p>
<p>One of my favorite characters so far!</p>
<p><em>Locke</em></p>
<p>Obviously a favorite.&nbsp; His backstory is incredibly touching (suspending disbelief for a bit -- wouldn't your legs have basically atrophened?)<br /></p>
<p><strong>Plot Lines</strong></p>
<p>Early on it's a bit repetative -- Group needs item X.&nbsp; Either A) Sawyer has X or B) is suspected of having X.&nbsp; Jack/Kate demanding it of Sawyer.&nbsp; Eventually we get back to status quo, having not really made any progress.&nbsp; There are other threads obviously, but the Jack/Kate/Sawyer triangle through the first half of the season is definitely the most dominant.</p>
<p>-- By the end of the season, there were multiple lines going at once, which kept things intersting and moving.&nbsp; Characters matured and/or became more flawed, which definitely helped.</p>
<p><strong>-- Believability</strong></p>
<p>I thought they had gone too far overboard in the second/third episode when they went looking for the radio on the plane.&nbsp; How were they going to reconcile something plucking the pilot out of the cockpit window with some that really exists (ala not a dinosaur).&nbsp; Over the first season, they slowly explained those aspects, though not at all completely.&nbsp; Will we get an explanation on how someone gets 30ft tall trees to shoot out of the ground like rockets?</p>
<p>Additionally, there are too many contrived character quirks/traits that while don't detract too much, I found to be a bit absurd (Hurley and Locke for example... possibly Walt but we don't know yet).&nbsp; Everyone else is pretty much dead on believable.</p>
<p>All in all an exceptional series.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see how many years they go.&nbsp; Granted, I never thought 24 would have the life it does.&nbsp; I watched the complete first season (DVD of course), and then snipits of the second season.&nbsp; Again, too many contrived twists just to extend the series to 24 episodes, when 18 or so would have done just fine.</p>
<p>Season 2 is on order.&nbsp; Though I will probably rewatch season 1 again before starting 2, just to make sure I haven't missed anything.<br /></p>
