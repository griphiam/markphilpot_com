I did a music video using the extended version of Within Temptation's "What Have You Done," again using scenes from Twilight. Once again, WMG are bastards and have blocked the audio on Youtube so I can't host them there, even though I thought they had reached an agreement a few months ago to start allowing their content. At some point, someone needs to clarify if amateur music videos are Fair Use (I believe so).

The original video is below.
