<p>I'm in a minimalist mood at the moment.&nbsp; The Wordpress 2.1 upgrade went without a hitch and since <a title="Ahead of its time" href="http://www.freshpursuits.com/canvas/">Canvas</a> looks like its been abandoned (hopefully to rise again... it had so much promise), I thought I would kick over to something different.&nbsp; I rather like this new approach.&nbsp; I still want to get in a few tweaks before it completely settles down, but that shouldn't take too long.</p>
<p>I have a few posts in the queue.&nbsp; bbiab.</p>
