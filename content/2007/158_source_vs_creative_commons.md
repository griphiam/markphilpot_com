<p>Mark Pilgrim has an <a title="dive into mark" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/02/15/cc-vs-gpl">interesting take</a> on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" title="Founded by Lawrence Lessig">Creative Common's</a> license.&nbsp; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons" title="CC">CC license</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft" title="GPL is from the same family">copyleft</a> framework that allows content creators to choose what rights to retain, and what to grant explicitly, rather than the all assuming copyright &copy;.&nbsp; The GPL was designed for source code.&nbsp; Applying it to other media runs the gamut of success stories.&nbsp; CC was intended for all possible works... from written text, images, video... anything that you would traditionally stick a &copy; on.</p>
<p>A encapsulated issue here is something <a title="Amazing public service" href="http://www.archive.org/index.php">archive.org</a> was created to handle.&nbsp; The nature of all things digital -- especially things residing on the internet -- means everything is susceptible to dramatic flux at the will of individuals, ISPs, general neglect, etc.&nbsp; If &quot;Source,&quot; once given freely can be so easily removed without consequence or enforcement, it really means the freedoms granted by CC are asterisked, doesn't it?&nbsp; There is a catch.&nbsp; Without the aid of organizations like archive.org or great care taken by the original creator, &quot;digital source&quot; is transient.</p>
<p>GPL'd source code I don't believe has the same issue (or at least not nearly the magnitude).&nbsp; You have Sourceforge, Linux package distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora), etc. who are set up to retain and distribute the source code as well as the binary it created.&nbsp; There is basically an institution and infrastructure in place to protect the &quot;digital source.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking a step back copyleft is fundamentally a new thought process.&nbsp; CC is much newer and much less prevalent than GPL.&nbsp; CC is a wonderful thing (especially when you can search databases for things (pictures, video, text) based on the type of CC license you need), but I think we will have to wait and see how the &quot;remix and return&quot; mentality holds up.<br /></p>
