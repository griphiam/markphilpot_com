<p>Wow, has it been this long?&nbsp; Anyone who ever checked this must have given up by now.&nbsp; Talk about killing your audience through inactivity.</p>
<p>Let me be the first to say, the spell checker in Firefox 2 is really nice to have.&nbsp; It unfortunately doesn't quite work with the editor I'm using right now (ChenPress -- the right click doesn't show the alternative spellings) but at least I get a red underline when its wrong.&nbsp; For reasons that will become clear soon, I'm basically doing the equivalent of a good dusting throughout the site.&nbsp; Fill in those few areas I've been meaning to get to but haven't.</p>
<p>I hope to have a movie review up soon, as well as a great announcement... so stay tuned.<br /></p>
