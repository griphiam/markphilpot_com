<p>This is some serious stuff!  It always hurt my arm to throw a wiffle ball (or even a tennis ball) that hard, but the action and movment is incredible!</p>

<p>Given the size of their bats, I'm surprised they hit any of those pitches.  I'm still not totally clear on the rules (how does base running work?), but it still looks fun!</p>
