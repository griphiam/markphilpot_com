<p>So the fantastic news is that Ann has been accepted to the Stanford Business School!!&nbsp; We are so excited and I'm incredibly proud of her (I know exactly how much work she put into it).&nbsp; Which means that indeed 2007 will be a year of very good change and transition.</p>
<p>We will probably end up living on campus and heading out to the Bay Area in the July/August time frame.&nbsp; In the mean time, we are both incredibly busy at work -- with the Democrats taking back Congress, and lots of GPS events (and travel).&nbsp; I'll try to keep everyone posted on developments (no pun intended).<br /></p>
