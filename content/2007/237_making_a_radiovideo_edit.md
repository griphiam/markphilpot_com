Question -- How do you take a 10 minute song and edit it down to a 3 minute video?

The obvious answers are either "cut 7 minutes" or "very carefully."

What I didn't realize is that <em>Pilot in the Sky of Dreams</em> (the great video I posted earlier) is really the 10 minute "epic" song on Threshold's new album <em>Dead Reckoning</em>.  Yet they managed to turn it into a great 3 minute video...  without me realizing the drastic edits they had made!  Really that's quite an accomplishment.

The full length song is really good.  The vocals on the bridge section are really awesome -- they should have tried to incorporate it (a four minute video isn't that much longer than a three).Â  All in all a great album, however if you want to try Threshold to get into it, I'd recommend starting with <em>Subsurface</em>.
