<p>A virtual unknown here in the States, <a href="http://www.nightwish.com">Nightwish</a> is a huge act in Europe.  Hailing from Finland, their first singer gave them a very unique sound -- a very operatic voice prevented them sounding like Evanescence (even though they predated the US act by almost a decade).  Tarja Turunen was quite literally an opera singer fronting a heavy metal band.  They split ways two years ago due to creative differences, and Nightwish spent a year and a half looking for a new female front (wo)man.  Looks like they finially found one... Their new album Dark Passion Play was released this week in Europe and their single Amaranth is #1 in a few countries.  I don't have the album yet, but I like the single.  Unfortunately a little close to Evanescence, but better sounding IMO (a little like <a href="http://www.within-temptation.com/">Within Temptation</a>).  I think their new singer Anette Olzo will be much more palatable to a larger audience (and being pretty damn cute at the same time... always key).  I don't like the video all that much, but the song is definitely catchy.</p>

<p><em>Amaranth</em></p>

<p>Baptised with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself</p>

<p>War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone</p>

<p>You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give</p>

<p>Caress the one, the Never-Fading
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak</p>

<p>Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time we reach
For the ones, whoever dare</p>

<p>You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give</p>

<p>Caress the one, the Never-Fading
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak</p>

<p>Reaching, searching for something untouched
Hearing voices of the Never-Fading calling</p>

<p>Caress the one, the Never-Fading
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak</p>
