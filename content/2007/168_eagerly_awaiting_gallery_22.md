<p>Two <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_2.2_RC1_released" title="release candidate 1">features</a> that have been a long time coming --</p>
<ul>
    <li>Virtual Albums -- aka &quot;Flickr style tags&quot;</li>
    <li>Improved Watermarking support</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been flirting with the features and interface of <a title="the proprietary solution" href="http://www.flickr.com">Flicker</a>.&nbsp; There is no doubt its highly polished and feature rich, but I just couldn't do the $24/year (even though its not a bad price) and give up the control and freedom of a &quot;host-your-own&quot; solution like <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery</a>.&nbsp; I took a quick <a title="very sparse, but you get the gist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_gallery_comparison">peek</a> at what the competition had to offer and still came back to Gallery hands down.</p>
<p>I really hate the enforced hierarchy of Gallery.&nbsp; Tags make sense for images as Flickr proves.&nbsp; Hopefully they put together a nice implementation.</p>
<p>Probably second to &quot;Flickr-like tags&quot; as far as number of feature requests, is more robust watermarking support.&nbsp; Now, you cant have a new watermark and say &quot;apply it to all images in this album&quot; -- you have to do it all by hand or re-upload the entire set (a serious pain).</p>
<p>I would expect RC-2 to appear very soon (order of weeks) with the official 2.2 release arriving around the end of March or beginning of April.&nbsp; The more and more I think about it, I'll probably upgrade when 2.2 RC-2 arrives so I can start playing around with the new functionality.<br /></p>
