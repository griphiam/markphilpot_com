There needs to be a new version of the "double quote."Â  One that conveys, not that I'm quoting someone or some text, but the equivalent to the "air quote" or "this is a concept that I'm emphasizing by enclosing it in quotations" quote.

Bottom line is that anyone who taught grammar would probably slap me upside the head and say, "No."
