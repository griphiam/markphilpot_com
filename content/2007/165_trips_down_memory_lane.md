<p>Related to a <a href="http://blog.mcstudios.net/2006/03/26/cartoon-nostalgia/">previous post</a> regarding great 80's cartoons, I stumbled upon a great <a title="Relax for a spell and enjoy" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bto7l3cKhvk">30 minute mix</a> of 80's cartoon intros.&nbsp; Needless to say it was a fantastic trip.&nbsp; You quickly realize there was a lot of great stuff that you remember very fondly, and then a bunch of stuff you've never heard of and think, &quot;Someone must really have been on something to come up with this.&quot;&nbsp; And the name Don Schimer keeps popping up as the producer for many of the early 80's shows... I'll have to look him up later.&nbsp; Anyway, on to the recap.<br /></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</strong> -- Starting right off with a classic.&nbsp; Yes, it was incredibly cheesy, but hey!&nbsp; They made a horrible 80's feature length live action <a title="oh it was bad" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093507/">movie</a> off of it (complete with Courtney Cox, believe it or not)!<br /></li>
    <li><strong>She-Ra - Princess of Power</strong> -- The female equivalent of He-Man.&nbsp; I vaguely recall this.&nbsp; They tweak thing just enough to make the whole &quot;boy-girl&quot; issue obvious (power vs wisdom, etc).<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Inspector Gadget</strong> -- Classic.&nbsp; Another one that gets a live action <a title="never saw it though" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141369/">movie</a>.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Ghostbusters</strong> -- Not the traditional cartoon and never saw this one.&nbsp; Looks almost like a spoof of Scooby Doo, but with a great big monkey instead of a dog.&nbsp; Go figure.<br /> </li>
    <li><strong>Ghostbusters</strong> --&nbsp; This is the real one.&nbsp; Classic.</li>
    <li><strong>Bravestar</strong> -- WTF?&nbsp; Planet of New Texas?&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Never seen this!&nbsp; Almost like a Native-American sheriff... in space!&nbsp; And the horse transforms to walk on too legs and act like a man!&nbsp; Someone was on crack for this one.</li>
    <li><strong>Heathcliff &amp; Marmaduke</strong> -- Oh wow.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Really, really bad.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Heathcliff</strong> -- The one you actually remember.&nbsp; Great music on the intro, but I never really liked the show.</li>
    <li><strong>Gilligan's Planet</strong> -- Oh... My... God.&nbsp; It is literally what you are thinking...&nbsp; The castaways of Gilligan's Island build a spaceship and travel to another planet.&nbsp; Complete with Gilligan, the Skipper, the Professor, etc.&nbsp; My jaw was slack the entire time.</li>
    <li><strong>Voltron</strong> -- Wow, I still get tingles.&nbsp; This is the shit!&nbsp; As I stated before, I actually bought some old tapes of the beginning episodes.&nbsp; Its was striking how Christian the show really was.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Mighty Orbots</strong> -- Never saw it.&nbsp; A cheesy imitation of Voltron.</li>
    <li><strong>Danger Mouse</strong> --&nbsp; Probably before &quot;my time.&quot;&nbsp; Heard of but never seen.&nbsp; Looks like a hang over from the 70's<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Duck Tales</strong> -- &quot;Life is like a hurricane...&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Da da da da danger lurks behind you...&quot;&nbsp; Awesome.</li>
    <li><strong>Chip N' Dale - Rescue Rangers</strong> -- We're getting to the classics now.&nbsp; The music on these intros was always usually good, to be ingrained in memory for all time.</li>
    <li><strong>The Littles</strong> -- Damn I remember this one!&nbsp; Not nearly as big as some others, but I definitely remember it.</li>
    <li><strong>Pacman</strong> -- The intro music is the remix of the old internal beeps from the arcade speakers.&nbsp; Definitely looks like a 70's hang over.</li>
    <li><strong>Captian N - the Game Master</strong> -- Shit I remember this one too!&nbsp; Very vaguely, but damn these were cheesy!&nbsp; When did Nintendo first make it big?&nbsp; I can't remember.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>The Super Mario Brothers Super Show</strong> -- I'm doubled over in laughter at the moment.&nbsp; Classic 80's rap intro with the show being divided between a cartoon and real actors as Mario and Luigi.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Mario looks like Ron Jeremy, I shit you not.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Super Mario Brothers</strong> -- The full cartoon minus the actors (and the Ron Jeremy look-alike).</li>
    <li><strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong> -- You gotta love the Nintendo spoofs.&nbsp; &quot;Excuuuuuse me Princess!&quot;<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Thundarr the Barbarian</strong> --&nbsp; Words escape me.&nbsp; Apparently a comet passes between the Earth and the moon and causes the Apocalypse in 1994.&nbsp; Almost looks like a He-Man spoof... with a monkey instead of a cat.&nbsp; What the hell is up with monkeys?<br /></li>
    <li><strong>GI Joe</strong> -- This show has such a different connotation now than it must have then.&nbsp; Replace Cobra with Al Qaeda and you have something that would be eerily familiar.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Transformers</strong> -- Another staple of 80's childhood.&nbsp; Bad intro though.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Transformers (v2)</strong> -- Planes, trains and automobiles.&nbsp; Definitely saw both.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Challenge of the Gobots</strong> -- Cheesy Transformer's spoof</li>
    <li><strong>Beatlejuice</strong> -- Another classic, but haven't we spilled into the 90's with this one?</li>
    <li><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</strong> -- Uber classic.</li>
    <li><strong>The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show</strong> -- Definitely 70's</li>
    <li><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> -- Holy shit!&nbsp; I can't believe this actually existed!</li>
    <li><strong>Blackstar</strong> -- Wow... someone's on crack for this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those 30, I definitely had seen at least 16 of them (at least one episode).&nbsp;&nbsp; However there are definitely a few that I'm sure were in the 80's that they missed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dark Wing Duck</li>
    <li>Tailspin</li>
    <li>Smurfs</li>
    <li>Thundercats</li>
    <li>Carebears</li>
</ul>
<p>And then a segment that were great cartoons in the 90's (when you were probably too old to be watching cartoons, but did anyway).&nbsp; You cannot say Anamaniacs was a childish cartoon =)<br /></p>
<ul>
    <li>Batman</li>
    <li>Gargoyles</li>
    <li>Anamaniacs</li>
    <li>X-Men</li>
</ul>
