<p>Some <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1172249109/" title="Looking forward to it">great news</a> out of the KDE 4 development: Dolphin will replace/coexist with Konqueror as the main file manager.&nbsp; One of my few issues with KDE is Konqueror -- trying to be both a web browser and a file manager, when it really is more a web browser.&nbsp; All the options are basically exclusively oriented toward web browsing and its incredibly convoluted &quot;Profile&quot; system.&nbsp; Its truely indicative of feature kreep.</p>
<p>Dolphin is my primary file manager, however its not truely integrated with the rest of KDE-- more of a standalone application.&nbsp; Giving users the option of an integrated and dedicated file manager is exactly what KDE has been missing.&nbsp; I'm impressed they are shooting for a summer '07 release.&nbsp; Looks like Fiesty+1 is shaping up to be quite a release.<br /></p>
