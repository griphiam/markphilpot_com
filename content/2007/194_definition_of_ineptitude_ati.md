<p class="dc">I've have struggled through driver hell trying to get Beryl to work with my graphics card an ATI Mobility 9600, only to be rebuffed, defeated, and vowing never to buy an ATI product as long as I live.</p>
If I had a desktop, I would have been on <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" title="Anyone remember the old Egghead stores?">Newegg</a> ordering a replacement weeks ago, but unfortunately, constrained with laptop hardware (where ATI has the dominant marketshare), I am left cursing ATI's dismal driver support (and I hear from <a href="http://jeff.specular.org/">Jeff</a> it's even a problem with their Window's drivers, which is even more unbelievable).

Support your damn products -- it is irresponsible and inexcusable.
