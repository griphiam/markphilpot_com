<i class="fa fa-retweet" aria-hidden="true"></i> I say this occasionally to normalize it:

I’ve never put code on GitHub
I’ve never done coding in my spare time for fun, side project, or portfolio
I’ve had a successful career as a developer

If you have done those things— great! Maybe I will too one day. But it isn’t necessary.
