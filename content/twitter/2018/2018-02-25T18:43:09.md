[@chrisbiscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi) What do you think about something like this: [ryanflorence.github.io/react-componenâ€¦](https://ryanflorence.github.io/react-component-component/)

I've been trying to be very disciplined about 1 component, 1 file. Obviously for reusable components, that stands, but this seems like an OK option for one off... Worth it or not?
