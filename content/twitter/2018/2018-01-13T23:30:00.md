<i class="fa fa-retweet" aria-hidden="true"></i> I really like this phrasing of the problem. Non-required "requirements" should be phrased as "this is where we think the position could go" and moved under a "nice to haves", "skills you can develop in this role", or similar section [twitter.com/Natashatashaetâ€¦](https://twitter.com/Natashatashaetc/status/951273514568368129)
