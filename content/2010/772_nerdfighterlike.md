<em>Update: 2010-04-20</em> -- Fixed some timing and EQ issues. Also programed some new drums.  Still working on solo.

Below is a rough cut of my rendition of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/devilishlypure">devilishlypure</a>'s song <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YonOpkx6K8">Nerdfighterlike</a></em> which was then done by Hank & Katherine Green <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjzG0mPXwxo">here</a> (of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers">vlogbrothers</a>).

It is fairly rough at the moment and missing the middle solo, as well as vocals (though in the process of exploring my home studio, I've determined my singing range is rather narrow).  Let me know what you think though.  I'm still getting used to my tools.

Drums were done in <a href="http://www.hydrogen-music.org/">Hydrogen</a> and mixing done with <a href="http://ardour.org/">Ardour</a>.
